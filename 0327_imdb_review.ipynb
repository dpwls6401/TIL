       "{'오징어 게임': [['Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably don\\'t need me to give you this warning. \"Squid Game\" is one of the most incredibly violent things you can watch and it\\'s NOT something you want to let your kids see. And, if your mother or Father O\\'Reilly drop by, you also might want to think twice before watching this South Korean mini-series with them! You\\'ll see hundreds dies, heads explode and tons of blood....just don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you!In many ways, the show is a lot like the Japanese movie \"Battle Royale\" or the \"Hunger Games\" films...but with one huge exception. Unless the unwilling participants in the other films, the folks in \"Squid Game\" know what they\\'re in for after the first round...and their deaths were because of their greed or situation in life.The film begins by showing you a bit of Seong Gi-hun\\'s life. He (Lee Jung-jae) is a loser in pretty much every way and his gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage. He\\'s deeply in debt to loan sharks who vow to kill him and you have a very hard time feeling sorry for the guy. He\\'s ruined his, his wife\\'s and his daughter\\'s lives.When one of his loan sharks catches up to him, you assume they\\'ll either beat Seong or kill him. Oddly, however, instead they have him sign a paper in blood....and in order to avoid being killed he signs it without hesitation. What he doesn\\'t realize is that by doing this, he\\'s agreed to enter one of the strangest gambling contests ever...if not the strangest.Seong arrives at the location the paper tells him to go to...but why, he isn\\'t sure. Soon a van pulls up and he enters...and is knocked out almost immediately. When he awakens, he\\'s with 455 other participants...who, at this point, have no idea what they\\'re in for with these strangely clad \\'hosts\\'. They are told they\\'re playing a game of Red Light/Green Light...and most of the folks think it\\'s all very childish. However, when the first one moves when it\\'s a red light, snipers kill him!!! Soon, they realize that they\\'d BETTER make it to the goal line before the allotted time or they\\'ll die...and die many of them do.After this \\'game\\', about 200 of them were killed. But here\\'s where it gets interesting. They are then allowed to vote as to whether to finish the game and go home or continue. By only one vote, they vote to go home. Episode two shows them at home...and it\\'s my favorite one of the shows in the series. At this point, most of the remaining players actually decide to return to the game, as many of them face death or prison if they quit the game. The final seven episodes are the continuation of the game...as well as showing the actions of a cop who manages to infiltrate the contest.Again, just to make things clear, this is a mega-violent show....even more so than the \"Fargo\" television series! But I kept watching despite this because the writing was simply exquisite and the characters in the game truly memorable...and in some cases, infamous. It also is exceptional because so much of it is hard to predict! Overall, a film that is different enough from \"Hunger Games\" and \"Battle Royale\" that it really works well. I found it so compelling, I watched the entire series in one evening....though I\\'d only planned on seeing and episode or two.By the way, if you care, the amount won in the contest is a bit more than $38,000,000 US dollars.',\n",
       "   \"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.\",\n",
       "   \"Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!\",\n",
       "   \"Mixed feelings on this one. The glorification of violence in shows like this tend to be desensitizing and seem to acclimate those with criminal tendencies to head down a wrong path. Yet the challenge of the individual games create a paradox of situations in which the viewer is steered toward thinking that certain players will work together, only to find they are pitted against each other, as in the marble game. The horror of that game was brought forth when a married couple naively decided to work together, only to be faced with the grim reality that there could only be one survivor. These kinds of situations were prevalent throughout the series episodes, making it almost impossible to know who would survive at the final outcome. Through it all, I believed there was something noteworthy about the old man, player #1 (Hideo Kimura), who's physical resemblance to an aged Korean Billy Crystal impinged on my brain every time I saw him (go back and see what I mean). Oddly, for such a large cast of characters, there weren't any that I could really connect with in a meaningful way. Perhaps the closest was player #240, young Ji-yeong (Vivian Lu, incorrectly identified in the credits as Sae-Byeok), eliminated in play when partnered with player #67 Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Hoyeon). Tied for most despicable characters were player #101 Deok-su (Paul Nakauchi) and player #212 Han Mi-neo (Stephanie Komure), so it was appropriate that they should be eliminated together in the Glass Stepping Stones game. The ending here seemed a little superfluous considering all that went before, with the old man Il-nam wagering a final personal bet against Gi-hun (Greg Chun), player #456, and winner of the grand prize of 45.6 billion won. Doing the conversion, that came to just under thirty nine million dollars, and seeing all those big numbers can really disorient the viewer. When Gi-hun paid the flower vendor at the end of the story a ten thousand won note for a single bunch, it seemed awful generous, until doing the math revealed it was about eight dollars and fifty cents.\",\n",
       "   'Even if you\\'ve seen \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Money Heist\", \"Squid Game\" (called \"Ojing-eo Geim\" in the original Korean) is still going to shock you. The sad thing is that so many people have no other choice but to risk everything like the characters here.Definitely see it. You\\'ll never look at any children\\'s game the same way again after seeing it.',\n",
       "   \"This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.\",\n",
       "   'Everybody has been talking about \"Squid Game.\" I\\'ve been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn\\'t feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don\\'t watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched \"Squid Game\" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it\\'s meh.To me it\\'s a Korean \"Hunger Games.\" I know that there are some big differences, but it\\'s still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we\\'re all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it\\'s a victim of its own hype, but I wasn\\'t that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn\\'t want to be in, but I will say that some of the \\'umph\\' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I\\'ve labeled this spoiler so I\\'ll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it\\'s a dead giveaway that they\\'re going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to \"Squid Game\" I say \"Meh.\" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn\\'t interest me enough. If \"Squid Game\" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would\\'ve been a lot better. That being said, I\\'m committed now. I would like to see what happens in season two.',\n",
       "   \"Exciting show that keeps you watching. The Korean part is the emotional connection with the characters and their financial problems and how they have family obligations. The violence although comically exaggerated is unusual for a K drama. Good acting from LSJ and PHS veteran actors. Striking set design gives it a visually glossy look. Whatever makes international audiences watch K dramas is good. This isn't a typical K drama and far from one of the best. But it's a swift watch.\",\n",
       "   \"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.\",\n",
       "   \"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON ONESeong (Lee Jung-Jae) is down on his luck, addicted to gambling and in debt to vicious loan sharks, not to mention eager to reacquaint with his estranged son. At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it's enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It's sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed.It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths 'reality TV' could sink to in the name of 'entertainment.'It's definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that's left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****\",\n",

       "   \"Squid Games (2021) is a series my wife and I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows people who choose to play child's games competitively for money that could change their life forever. Shortly after they arrive they discover the price for losing is rather expensive. This series was directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk (The Fortes and My Father) and stars Lee Jung-jae (New World), Park Hae-soo (Time to Hunt), Oh Yeong-su (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring) and Jung Hoyeon (100%: Beat). The storyline for this series is very unique and was a creative spin on similar films like Battle Royale, Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies. The concepts were well thought-out and paced and the characters are very well developed. The storyline and characters evolve well throughout the series. The games and settings are amazing and they used great colors and cinematography to present each scenario. The costumes and props were obviously outstanding as well. My one complaint was the main character who was painfully annoying throughout the series and completely ruined the end for me. The gore and kill scenes in this are unique and very well done. I'd score this series a 7.5/10 and would consider it an absolutely must see.\",\n",
       "   \"I recently got into Netflix again I take breaks and use other services glad I finally decided to watch this whacky series! Probably get hate for this but I watch the English dub version cause I don't do well with subtitles still lovable show. The music, flow of everything, absurdity, and story is all excellent!\",\n",
       "   \"Squid Game is no show that hit me that much - I watched a couple of episodes and was rather bored, I would prefer to watch some real MMA fights - more excitement and action going on, and less drama. The first episode dragged on and on and on till the first real action. The second episode was a rather redundant detour of the story. The idea or concept is also nothing really new: Stephen King aka Richard Bachman, The Long Walk and The Running Man, or movies like Battle Royal, The Hunger Games, Death Race, Circle, Cube or 13 and many more precede Squid Game. So what's left? Some nice ideas (the games), some solid action and a sip of blood, but with too much uninteresting filler time. Summa summarum: Not that bad but rather just another hype, just my few cents of course.\",\n",
       "   'Korean Drama \"Squid Game\" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more \\'Korean Drama\\' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10.',\n",
       "   \"Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn't fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me.\",\n",

Ep4 Loving the jokes of macabre and bloodthirsty children, catching love for the characters, and hatred for the villains...\\nEp 6 the construction of the characters was perfect, the games give a sarcastic and sadistic tone, however the dialogues are the high point, with that black humor that the Koreans do so well, the conversations between the characters are intelligent, with a quick script, everything very captivating and mesmerizing, the players and the undercover cop, showing the other side of the game... Lovely..\\nEp 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios...\\nI finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried... Beautiful, beautiful... But I saw many truths there, in real life it would be more or less like this...\",\n",
       "   'A group of desperate people agree to play high-stakes children\\'s games, and then find how high the stakes really are. The show is an odd mix of nonsense and excellence. The premise is interesting but the ultimate revelation about the games and their founder is simplistic and does little explain the provenance of the vast, complex yet secret game venue. There are some hints at secondary plotlines but they go nowhere and the introduction of wealthy gamblers is a heavy-handed social-commentary that adds nothing to the story (and leads to the weakest moments in the series). The acting and characters are excellent and the dark shifts in their motives and ethics as more and more players are \\'eliminated\\' is expertly done (episode 6, \"Gganbu\" is a highlight). The imagery, especially the creepy geometric enforcers, the \\'play grounds\\' and the multicolored stairs that look like something from an Escher etching is memorable (and may be what really sets \\'Squid Game\\' apart from similar \\'deadly games\\' series). The film is quite violent, both in a cartoony way and in a more visceral \\'realistic\\' and disturbing way. Not to everyone\\'s\\' taste but entertaining and compelling.',\n",

They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained.',\n",
       "   'The usage of children games in an adult world is catchy, but the realism behind all this is somewhat shaky - South Korea is no \"Wild West\" and one can hardly think of events like this happening there, with so large body count... The idea of fierce contests with elimination has been utilised before, plus it is hard to maintain a thrill when there are leading performers from the beginning apparently not dying before the end...Underplots are not too elaborate and they tend to \"mince\" the main plot. Luckily, this anti-capitalist idea is not overhanging too much. The number of episodes could be less, but some good twists in the final one elevated the thrill that began to fade away in e.g. Episodes 7 and 8.However, the performances are interesting, so different for the Western ones, how they react and how they depict, with men more versatile though. Lee Jung-jae and O Yeong-su were most to my liking, the latter providing a nice twist towards the end as well...Season 2 might be underway - based on the ending scenes... I would probably watch it as well. But not impatient though.',\n",

If they survive all six games over a six-day period, they\\'ll walk away with a whopping 45.6-billion won (roughly, a little over $38.5 million in U.

I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn't need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health.\",\n",
       "   'This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses \"Hunger Games\" as it\\'s base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of \"actors\" playing the VIPs.

The sets were good, the characters were good especially the lead and the english dubbing wasn't too bad! The TV Show is gory & dark in a lot of areas & reminds me of the Hunger Games crossed with Saw!The only things that I found were off were the filler parts of the Show, the talking parts, the drawn out scenes all seemed to drag quite a bit, ok character development is a must, but cutting it down & getting to the point is also a must not to mention consistancy!Overall, it's a good Show with a creative premise and good story to follow! The games are creative with their own dark & sinister twist to them! The Show does drag in areas, but is pretty entertaining all the way! Roll on Series 2!7/10.\",\n",
       "   'Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan\\'s Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the \"losers\" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers \"side-hustle\" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the \"real\" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed \"worthless\".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but \"manga\" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I\\'m giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers.',\n",
       "   \"I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories. And on top of all this, there's this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10.\",\n",

       "   \"Squid Game isn't easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that's what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid's games.Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic's devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show's all-English dub.In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who've got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the 'PlayStation Men' and mysterious leader.Squid Game is Netflix's unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there'll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won't.Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time.\",\n",
       "   'Review By Kamal KDark portrayals of greed, low self value and distorted view of reality based on the twisted social standards that are rooted in the obsession over money that takes away all the joy of life - all wrapped in a completely unrealistic scenario sprinkled with dark comedy tone, that emphasizes the absurdity of the characters\\' choices and behaviors.The childlike locations and games present a drastic contract to the brutality of the scenarios the characters are facing. The game creators put themselves in the position of innocent keepers of the rules, and any tragic deaths are the fault of the participants for breaking them. No one is forced to participate - you signed your death certificate yourself.Survival in the game and survival in daily life serve as another good contrast - the physical brutality versus the emotional and existential dread. It\\'s more than survival games drama, the true horror is the reality of these people outside of the games and what they can do in the given situation to change it.Blood and murder are this show\\'s best friends, be aware of that before watching. Realistically speaking, this is not some new higher level of gruesome scenes, but they don\\'t shy away from showcasing deaths and accidents.The acting from all the adults was truly amazing. Like in any drama, some roles had more depth and were more demanding than others, but none of the characters felt like an empty placeholder to fill the scene.But then we had the group of foreign actors with such an exaggerated line delivery, I was thinking I\\'d rather mute the screen. Not one of them did a good job. All sounded like licence free sound bites.Any flaws or complaints?Depends on what you are looking for. Do not expect any elaborate death traps and clever tricks - it\\'s far more simple. It is pure survival with technically simple rules and games. You won\\'t wreck your brain trying to understand what is going on, since the plot is rather straightforward with no unexpected plot twists that turn the whole plot upside down.You might want to sit down and analyze the message of the show and what might be the meaning behind. Depending on the viewer it could be a decent kill count watch with a bit of excitement, or a depressing portrayal of collapsing morals and society, as the money sucks all the joy out of our lives.There has also been a random sex scene, and I don\\'t think we needed that \"final\" nail in the coffin - it was clear even without it that people would do anything for survival and money.Some details make exactly zero sense, and I truly mean zero. If you are lucky, you will not notice them at all, since they are less than minor. Squid Game is not exactly free from plot holes, but none of them have a big impact on the story. Some plot lines do hit the dead end though.Overall, it was a brutal drama, yet somehow I found myself laughing at quite a number of scenes. The dark comedy, calling out the hypocrisy - all that was truly amazing. 2/3 of the show was a solid 9.5, and I\\'m a bit frustrated with where the show went after that. Still, quite an enjoyable watch, with interesting set designs, well written characters and some solid thrills. They were able to get me attached to the characters and feel their desperation and pain.',\n",

The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that's a good thing.

This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special.

Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some \\'Masterpiece\\'. Contrary to popular belief, it\\'s not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn\\'t be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I\\'m leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?',\n",

The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings).\",\n",

       "   \"So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main Character\\nLee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Supporting Characters\\nThere is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story\\nThe story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script\\nThe script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.Style\\nThe show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.Overall\\nOverall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score. It is a must watch and don't let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible.Rating - 9/10.\",\n",
       "   'A great story and sufficient background to get the series started with the pilot episode. But by the 4th eps it\\'s dragging quite a bit and they make a scene ensuring that all the games are of \"fair play\".Two games later they throw out this concept and it\\'s all based on luck instead of skill. Absolutely terrible games of chance.This dude shopped this project around for 10 years before Netflix picked it up. Maybe in that time he should have had a few buddies proof read the script and give him some pointers. This needs work.I\\'m sure that there will be a season 2 for this, hopefully with some better talent can help this dude write a better script. Could have been a 9 star series but just got boring and predictable.',\n",

Of course it drags 30 minute episodes into 1 hour long episodes..but its still good. Both twists were so predictable. The police brother and the old man were so obvious...and what is the message of the show...Being rich is just awful...lol Korea must have lots of poor people.',\n",

I loved all nine episodes - it was funny, tragic, violent, and suspenseful. There was some gore in this show - but it wasn't done without catharsis. The acting in this show is just tremendous, especially the lead actor. And the writing is excellent. One of the most important binge shows of our time.\",\n",

This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of \"we play fair games against each other, based on skill\" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn\\'t completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don\\'t completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that.',\n",

It's just the vision of its creators - and that's fresh nowadays.I know people complain about the ending, but if you watch Alice in Borderlands (which you should, it's also a great show, Japanese this time) you'll know what a bad ending really is. That show didn't end with any conclusion.But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens.In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality. The characters are mostly cliches we've seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games.But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now.\",\n",

A double-edged sword. The protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) - an unemployed chauffeur who slipped into gambling addiction after losing his job - depends not only on the prize money to gain custody of his daughter, but also to one to pay for an important operation for his mother. He becomes part of a show for life and death.A mass extinction staged by Netflix. Is this good or bad? You can look at it, even if a lot is reminiscent of Stephen King.',\n",

Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.Just the right amount of gore for my taste.----What I didn't like about itVIPs were so cringe. I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.The cop storyline was a little off-putting.

It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life.

       "   \"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out.\",\n",
       "   \"Utterly gripping, engrossing, and devastating, Squid Games hit's a level of tension few other series have. It's not perfect, a little consistent for a single episode, but it is so absorbing at every other moment it seems impossible to mark the series down.Characters are distinct, develop brilliant bonds and each have their own developmental arc. Certain characters show such morality and innocence that investment is put into their stories almost instantly. Backstories are a mixture of tragic and sinister, providing a footing for the audience to base their impressions, but these are twisted and warped so brilliantly throughout that a fully-fleshed out character is always the final product.Acting cannot be faulted, and as a newcomer to Korean TV, all impressions of the actors are fresh. Outbursts of emotion are very explosive, and should be seen and heard in Korean to fully appreciate them.The plot has maybe been played out in various ways in past media, but possibly without such a holistic approach. Down-on-their-luck participants playing life-or-death children's games seems simple, but the execution is perfect due to the building tension. Violence is graphic and intense, but the gore comes in relatively short bursts. The progression of each episode gives the violence such power.One episode in particular is crushing, once a connection has been formed between the audience and each character. The cruelty of each game is paramount, but the reactions within them are devastating.Unfortunately, the most devastating episode is followed by the most disappointing. The introduction of the VIPs is so below the standard of the rest of the characters/series, leaving them out completely and keeping some irritating mystery would have been a lot more satisfying than the lacklustre impact they make. Built on cliches and stuck with terrible dialogue not improved by the acting, it's the one episode that goes against the rest of the series.Having said that, it may have been a necessary evil. It matches with the storyline, but still felt like an addition no one wanted. It cannot detract from the entire series though, everything before is brilliant, everything after saves it again, producing a worthy ending.\",\n",
       "   \"This is the first Korean drama I've watched while I was absolutely blown away.

I can't wait to see what happens in the next series.\",\n",
       "   \"A little too much of an advertised series for my taste. I decided to give it a try anyway, there aren't a lot of episodes anyway. Overall, I have to admit that it is a very good series, the best part of it are some of the characters and how various circumstances and the environment affect them. I was mentally prepared for the violence and the blood so it didn't surprise me, I even thought the violence would be even more pronounced. Of these nine episodes, three were below level for me personally, including an ending I didn't like. There are also a few elements in the series that aren't original because we've seen them before, it's not a new concept of how people fight to the death to win a competition. It is somewhat predictable. That's why everything else in the series is at a very high level, the story, the characters, the mystery, I give it two thumbs up.\",\n",

From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.However.

       "   'Caught a bit by the hype I decided to check this out and boy was I in for a convoluted messy nonsense pile of garbage.I will not go through all the problems with each episode but rather describe the three overarching issues I have with the show.1) the acting - the acting is fine from the 3-4-5 main characters, everyone else however are horrible at it. Someone said that is the point, okay, sure, but if so you direct them different and give them less to do and more to the point scenes so their extremely bad acting do not shine through.2) the production value - this is so low budget that I had a good cry at least half a dozen times each episode. Sets are literary falling apart and you can clearly see the bad construction. You can also hear the lousy music, see the bad clothing, the low quality film work etc. Etc. This is like high-school students having a laugh level of production value.3) Cliche and tiresome nonsense - we have seen all of this many, many times before. All done better, with better acting, better production value, better directing, better story and with a lot better social criticism. This is just a bored Korean mixing some of his favourite movies and tv shows together into nonsens while claiming he is doing the world a favour by exposing capitalism... yawn... Perhaps look a bit north you dirty wet sock of a man you.Put the above together with further critique of each episode and you have some boring nonsense no one should care about. Not sure why people do, but people running around with face masks injecting themselves and bending over for the global elite is surely to like anything you put in front of them.

The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral.

The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they originally are comedians.

It\\'s not really surprising that Squid Game arrived from the Eastern cinema, considering the Western Cinema has been dry out of ideas for years at this point. Squid Game is just such a breath of fresh air in 2021, because so far in this year all we got was trash.This show is just so compelling in almost every way. The characters all have differing personalities and ideas and motives, making each character likable in their own different ways. There\\'s no such thing as a \"perfect\" character in Squid Game; everybody is trying to win and they\\'ll give up their own morals to survive. This show focuses on the dark sides of humanity, and it doesn\\'t shy away of what people can do to each other, and that\\'s why this show is so refreshing, because we have realistic people doing realistic things.The overall concept of Squid Game isn\\'t really all that innovative, (a battle royal-ish game being spectated by privileged rich people), but everything around it is innovative. The set design is just fantastic. It\\'s colorful with a bright aesthetic which contrasts well with the dark themes. The directing and acting is also really solid all around, and the pacing is perfect. The only issue being a subplot that ends up leading to nothing.Squid Game is an overall masterpiece of a show. It\\'s extremely thrilling and it\\'ll pull your heartstrings. It\\'s an easy show to get emotionally invested in, and it ends in the most dramatic way possible.

       "   \"SummarySquid Game is a series with a wonderful production design, a staging that displays a powerful iconography and that admits several readings and records various influences and cinematographic antecedents. Anyway, it is mostly a thriller and a melodrama. Erecting it as a sociopolitical essay is perhaps an excess, although the crude allegory of neoliberal capitalism is clear and its anti-meritocratic message is accurate.REVIEW:456 people with a desperate economic situation agree to risk their lives in a series of games that take place in a concentration environment to win a significant sum of money.I am a person who distrusts the massive successes, so I began to see the series with all the precautions of the case; however, it turned out to be an extremely interesting experience.The gamesThe participants become part of a regime that is concentration-oriented for more than one reason: because of seclusion, military surveillance, because of its violence, cruelty and sadism, and because of its disregard for the human condition and life. The games (based on children's games) are extremely different and generate different and changing dynamics between the participants and a variety of climates between the chapters, although they all display different types of violence. The fewer participants there are, the bigger the prize becomes.The playersThose who play these games constitute a heterogeneous group of desperate people, generally downfalls of the system and highly indebted, the latter situation that alludes to a widespread problem that afflicts South Korea. Their situation pushes them to put their lives at risk, to which they no longer find meaning, and to commit atrocious acts for economic salvation. Little by little the plot will focus on a group of characters, some of whom nevertheless retain traits of humanity in the midst of despair.The systemOne of the first questions that assail the viewer is who is behind the Squid Game, who is organizing it and for what purpose. Unveiling this unknown is essential for the credibility of the story. What's more, it is initially the most intriguing part of the series, as the games and the place where they take place exhibit an extremely sophisticated and expensive organization and infrastructure.Production design and stagingOne of the highlights of the series is its wonderful production design: colorful, creative, elegant and imposing. It exhibits a powerful iconography that allows you to create a world of your own. As in all Korean series, the staging is brilliant, from the intimate melodramatic scenes to the suspense or violence of the games or in combination. Knows how to use the sequence shot and the fixed shot.The gendersThe series can be defined as a thriller profusely watered with gore, crossed, as in any Korean production worth its salt, by the most resounding melodrama when it investigates the stories and motivations of its characters and their interactions during and outside of games. At a certain point, he even ventures into the western.The cinematographic backgroundSquid Game, due to its internal logic, recognizes several cinematographic antecedents; Among others, one can cite Cronenberg's Videodrome and the saga The Hunger Games, only that it takes place in a rigorous present. But there is another little-cited reference: the concentration regime and other elements refer to Pasolioni's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Other aspects are reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick. Its powerful iconography and staging that create worlds of their own can also be assimilated to those of The Handmaid's Tale.Social, economic and political readingsAlthough I consider that these readings are somewhat overvalued or overanalyzed, it is clear that the dynamics of the games and their participants can be assimilated to that of neoliberal capitalism in its extreme forms (as was Nazism at the time), so much so that it concerns the participants as well as their organizers; it even raises up to a culmination of its predatory logic. A supposed and cynical framework of equal opportunities governs where, however, chance is decisive and despair and the promotion of extreme individualism permanently abort the collective organization. The series also shatters the meritocratic fantasy.The performancesThe performances are very good; They range from naturalism to a certain common buff emphasis on oriental gestures and dramaturgy. They generate empathy and mixed feelings based on the changing behaviors of their characters.The soundtrackSpecial mention for the remarkable soundtrack, which, as in the story, ranges from meditative piano solos to frenetic rhythmic sequences.\",\n",

The further along this series gets, the more I\\'m starting to enjoy it, but also it\\'s becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of \"Animal World!\" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who\\'s going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can\\'t pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom\\'s house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they\\'re way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn\\'t find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they\\'ve hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I\\'m right or wrong. It\\'s a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don\\'t use a movie like a precise blueprint, that\\'s just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I\\'m hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!',\n",

It\\'s a great concept with people playing games with each other for a big money prize at the very end and the losers get killed. The 3 first games are fine enough, but only the first one is great. It does feel like it\\'s always a promise of something bigger and better. Some big reveal that will make the TV show better and deliver on all the hidden factors. But in reality the more they reveal the worse the show gets. It\\'s like revealing the monster in a movie to be some bad CGI creature. Episode 6 already contains a very weak nonsensical game. And the last 2 games are bad. So out of 6 games only 1 was good! That\\'s pretty lame. The twist and turns also all lead to a worse TV show unfortunately. The first 2 episodes promise something big, but instead the show jumps the shark.A gang starts killing other competitors. But why? The more participants are left the higher is your own chance of survival as each participant is testing the games and finding out how to play them better so that everyone\\'s chance of survival increases. So if the gang didn\\'t kill anyone their chance of survival would skyrocket and they could just kill anyone they want before the last game.There is also a side-plot with a cop filming everything. This plot goes nowhere. He is just killed by his brother who runs the game place. But what the cop does makes no sense. For example, as he escapes they see him climb down a ladder. Before they got to him he had already put on a random diving suit and jumped into the water. So we are to believe this happened in maybe 2 minutes? We didn\\'t even know if he could dive or not. It\\'s also not clear why his brother runs the place. He just left his small cheap apartment suddenly and let his fish die to be this extremely powerful figure? The cop later throws his oxygen tanks on a beach while a boat searches for him. So of course they see the oxygen tank from afar and know he is there. These sort of things at the end of the show make no sense. He could have easily hidden on the island and then later found some fishing boat he could wave at.The main problem is of course the big reveal. It\\'s all a violent show for billionaires so they watch people in debt kill each other for a prize. This idea has been explored a thousand times before in many B movies and it doesn\\'t work here either. These Westerners are HORRIBLE actors. It\\'s inexcusable. You can easily get a random person to act better than this. But I assume they were directed by someone who didn\\'t speak English? The episodes they are in are obviously not fun to watch for anyone.And then there are the game rules. They make no sense and are not clearly explained. At times you see some huge twist in a game and a participant saying \"Well, you said the rules were such and such so that\\'s how I won the game\". So after the fact we get some info about how this guy broke a game. This is a thing in all 6 games. The rules are vague and winners and losers just come about by some mystery. It\\'s not terrible, just a bit weak as it makes little sense. In game 5 on the glass panels you even see the game maker shut off the light to make the game harder as they were near the very end. The game maker needed the last game to only have 2 survivors as only 1 winner is allowed. So while everyone thinks there is no limit and groups plan to win together in reality only one person can win yet no one knows this besides the game maker himself. This is also why the moderators let people kill each other and change the games as they are ongoing to kill a few more people. Also, the gang gets info about what game they are to play beforehand. Kinda a huge deal. These sort of changes and twists make it harder to really feel like these are real games. Rather it\\'s just methods to kill people. The rules are never fair. At one point a game maker even takes part in a game and makes his own team win. Honestly, the reveals are horrible. The brother reveal makes no sense as we don\\'t even know how the cop or brother is. And the old guy who also plays the games is a bad reveal too because it\\'s just a random twist. It\\'s not some info we were looking for.The ending makes no sense either. The winner doesn\\'t spend any money even though he promised to help some specific people. Family members of friends killed in the game. And at the end he just walks somewhere. We never really understand what his plans are. If he or 500 other people wanted to they could have revealed the game. We even see him talk to cops. And many others surely also talked to cops. Even in the VIP areas were see a bunch of waiters and naked ladies just laying around. So all these random naked ladies know about all these murders too. Of course all the workers know about this too. If you want to have an ending with the winner trying to reveal the whole thing that makes absolutely no sense because he could have tracked this whole operation down in a week. They leave clues everywhere. If you put this info online people would find the location in a day. They would just search for underground buildings with huge automatic roofs that can open. Such projects would have thousands of workers and can be seen from space. This part of the TV show makes zero sense so having the lead decide to finally do something about it after a year makes no sense whatsoever. He could have revealed it all in a day. Anyone could. This and then the 2 big twist reveals are terrible. It\\'s not really anything huge so you may just ignore it. But it illustrates how bad the writing actually is. It shows why the games are stupid and lazy too. It\\'s not smart stuff.',\n",

The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season).',\n",

       "   \"Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!\",\n",
       "   \"Pros:\\n1. There is great use of the colour palette, with greys, blacks, whites, browns and navy blues in the outside world used to portray a miserable, lifeless and oppressive world, whereas bright colours are used for Squid Game to ironically convey a place of death where they felt more alive and unburdened than they did in the outside world.2. The gore is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it's never over-the-top which helps the gore feel more real.3. The fight/ action scenes are raw and gritty, with the usage of close-up shots to heighten the claustrophobia and personal touch, thereby heightening the tension.4. The score does an incredible job at building up the atmosphere, in addition to being instantly recognisable.5. The deaths of Ali (Anupam Tripathi) Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) and Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) are deftly handled and are real tear-jerkers.6. The practical effects and set design are beautifully designed and they do an amazing job at building the Squid Game world.7. The show provides a really good psychological study on how humans react when their lives and fortunes are on the line, i.e. Self-preservation or cooperation; decisive or indecisive.8. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is on the receiving end of a satisfying character ark from irresponsible, lazy and indecisive, to the complete opposite.9. There are phenomenal performances by Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo).Cons:\\n1. The flashbacks inserted to reiterate information the show has already told the audience, are redundant and patronising.2. It's baffling, and largely unbelievable, that the Squid Game operation has been going since 1999, yet only one cop in the recent year found multiple disappearances strange enough to investigate - and he was only investigating because of his brother.3. It was far too easy for Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-Joon) to infiltrate the secret island. You'd think that type of operation wouldn't make it as easy as they did to sneak onto the island.4. A lot of the information divulged during the show is done so via lazy exposition, the show doesn't seem to deem the audience intelligent enough to work things out for themselves.5. The criticism of the modern Neo-liberal, hyper-individualistic, capitalist system is rather on-the-nose, and it feels preachy and pretentious most of the time. There's a bizarre sub-theme of anti-Americanism and white supremacy that just feels forced.6. There is a ridiculous amount of screen-time wasted on a bizarre organ-harvesting sub-plot that doesn't go anywhere, and is clearly just placed so that the show can air the supposed virtue of equality and fairness, whilst Front man (Lee Byung-hun) who airs it, sanctions the killings of people who for whatever reason, found themselves in debt.\",\n",
       "   \"Takes the physiological killer game show idea from anime and manga and adapts into live action. After you get past the premise you actually find well written characters and doomed relationships which is very refreshing for an Anime plot.

Don't watch this for the premise watch it for the relationships.\",\n",

       "   'Yes, it\\'s like the Japanese game genres like Liars Game, Death Note...etc but much more interesting characters and social commentary.Yes, in its core a social experiment like Lord of the Flies but then the main character is from A Man for all Seasons. The show basically ask will you be true to yourself? Do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person(deep down), believes in the goodness of humanity. Goodness of other people. (Just look at his smiley photo snapshot). Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the \"reasoning\" behind it all.001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of \"rosebud\" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to...childhood. But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk). Na, they have a space race to run.There are many threads to follow up on if there\\'s a 2nd season. The origin of this game. The cop that jumped off the cliff. The recruiter in the subway. And obviously will the main character go back to another game? And if so what will he do?I get there are bad acting segment with the VIP. But the they do serve the representation of crass upper class. Overall the length of the series is just right. Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions (the marble episode comes to mind), tense (first game, voting, tug of war, formation of groups ) and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity. Great cinematography, color palette, bgm score, sets, character development, production and plot.The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values. And ask again, will you be true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old man. But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life. Double irony that he didn\\'t get to see the results.Do you believe in the goodness of people?',\n",

The purity of children\\'s games and the life-to-life struggle between adults form a contrast, which is even more ironic. The character settings, personalities, and relationship portrayals are not bad. But the reversal of the ending is really a forced reversal, anticlimactic.',\n",
       "   \"A masterful series for its great script and interpretation of its actors. Lee Jung-jae has done a wonderful performance, but the best thing about this series is seeing human behavior and despair of not having money to live. We live in a world with money and without it you are nothing, and because of that money we are losing humanity itself, in a world that is increasingly populated and with less work to survive. The numbers don't add up, we'll see what the future holds for everyone due to lack of money.\",\n",
       "   'I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they\\'re giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (the works hold back neither in terms of the raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don\\'t necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it \"suspiciously popular\". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that\\'s clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be \"hip\", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven\\'t seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current \"cool\" thing to consume and didn\\'t grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don\\'t make sense about the setting, which, as per the show\\'s themes and social satire, aren\\'t supposed to make sense).Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don\\'t understand it and enjoy it \"in spite of some plot holes\").At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it\\'s also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children\\'s games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It\\'s around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won\\'t reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn\\'t end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden \"Player 1\" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I\\'ve seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It\\'s not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it\\'s hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn\\'t the same as Plot Armor.My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People™ from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show\\'s poetry and dramatic timing.Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won\\'t be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it\\'s \"cool\" or not. Still, it\\'s hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show\\'s message.I\\'m told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it\\'s worth, the mainstream reaction could\\'ve been much worse. (My generation isn\\'t much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I\\'m truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go \"Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!\"',\n",

       "   \"This show was phenomenal. I didn't start watching it for a few weeks after it came out because it didn't seem super interesting. It didn't appeal to me. But then it stayed at #1 on Netflix for over a month, everyone was talking about, and it seemed like the only thing on social media at the time, so I decided to check it out. I speak English, but I wanted to have the true show experience, so I watched it in Korean. I wanted to hear the actors real voices, and it bothers me when the voice doesn't match up with the movement on the screen. Regardless, the Korean actors were great. I don't know how to judge actors when they are speaking Korean, but it seemed really well done. I was skeptical about watching the VIP episode because of what people said about their acting. To be honest, I couldn't figure out what was so bad about it. Sure it wasn't amazing, and they were weird at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people said it was. I've talked about the acting, now I will talk about the show. Hwang Dong-hyuk is a genius. The plot of this show was so unique and so cool to watch. Every game that played was very entertaining to watch, it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I also liked how the show wasn't just these people playing kids games, it actually explored some of the characters lives. I just thought it was cool. Lastly, I loved the characters. All of them were great, but my favorites had to be Gi-hun, Ali, and the Old Man. Their characters were just so likable. Those were just my favorites, there were so many more I liked.If you haven't already, I definitely recommend watching this to anyone, you won't regret it. My recommendation is to watch the snow in Korean, but if you are just looking to relax and not read the subtitles whenever someone talks, watch it in your main language. I really hope there is a season 2, it will be cool to see what they do after the ending.\",\n",
       "   \"Terrific show; a timely watch. While it certainly dabbles in issues regarding social status, I more so saw this show's narrative as a debate on society's morality and compassion. Mixing offbeat scenarios with unyielding brutality, Squid Game shows how desperate, callous and even savage humans can be when the conditions are met and that capitalism serves more as a byproduct of these behaviors. It asks the question: Does humanity still possess any decency in such an oppressed and unforgiving world? Highly recommend it. It's a breath of fresh air for anyone craving something unique. A gripping survival drama full of palpable suspense and sharp commentary.\",\n",
       "   \"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)\",\n",

       "   \"I'm usually not one to instantly check a show out when it's trending, but after seeing so many TikTok videos of people trying to cut perfect shapes out of the famous Dalgona snack cookies with small needles, and seeing how the stakes couldn't get much higher what with those who failed at said task would get killed (which was very jarring), I caved in and decided to see what I was missing. And after episode 9 ended, I want more. Because not only did the hype behind this show click, but it also may be even better than I thought it would already be. And me wanting more isn't me saying that the season was too short or anything, but considering how near flawlessly everything worked here, I've never been this interested in a show like this in a long time. One of the reasons for this are the characters. They're all so damn good and well written. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Ali, Il-Nam, Sae-byeok, Jun-ho, and pretty much everyone else are all effective and very likable, even those who took villainous paths (being vague to avoid spoilers). This is emphasized by the performances, as they are absolutely phenomenal, as everyone here kills it. I felt the fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and tiredness from everyone here, making this have some of the best casting I've seen in a show yet. The story, as well, is superb. To keep it somewhat brief, it's essentially how people who are in massive amounts of debt are taken to a secret island where they must play childhood-like games to win-except, if you lose one of them, you don't just lose the game. You lose your life. At first, that may seem somewhat simple. But the way this show handles it with its excellent pacing, characterization, and world building (all with lots of gore), it works very, very well. It's not only tense, but it's very emotional. And that goes for all 9 episodes here. I was constantly at the edge of my seat. This show is also an excellent parody of capitalism, as it loosely portrays how the top 1% looks down on everyone else, and that even though money is the driving factor for everyone else, it's not necessarily money that makes life better-because the top 1% rot their brains of greed and are actually worse. So much so, that the lives of fellow people who are poor don't matter as much. And I think this show nailed that wonderfully. Overall, the first season is masterfully written, directed, performed, and executed, and I'm very excited to see what the inevitable season 2 brings to the table, because so far, this is one of the best shows I've seen in the past decade, and I hope Hwang Dong-hyuk keeps up the pace, because he did one hell of a job, here.\",\n",

I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)\\nThere were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.\",\n",
       "   'As survival series go, \"Squid Game\" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a \"Hunger Games\", \"Saw\", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.The show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and \\'convenience zones\\'. He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.Jaeil Jung\\'s musical scoring more than \\'made it work\\' where this series was concerned. He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.A few negatives... There were no cameras in the restrooms. This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another \\'tricky\\' omission. The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. However, these and a handful of other \\'loopholes\\' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that\\'s where the magic lay in this series.I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version. Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. That\\'s how I watched \"Squid Game\" on Netflix. The \\'feel\\' was so much different than when I \\'tested\\' a few minutes of the show in its English dub.Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.With Netflix\\'s \"Squid Game\" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a \\'dark\\' mark one won\\'t soon forget. He proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. \"Squid Game\" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our \\'better nature\\'.',\n",

This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.\",\n",
       "   \"IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless. It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement.\",\n",
       "   \"And I'm hard to please!Being a massive fan of Korean cinema and horror I couldn't help sitting through the first three episodes happily identifying all the obvious influences which were by no means restricted to Korean cinema and horror.So the obvious comparisons with films like Old Boy and the Sympathy with Lady vengeance are there. The deshevilled under class of loan dependent opportunists of Parasite.But then there was the island of the Japanese classic, Battle Royale or the cult British 60's TV series, The Prisoner. Additionally there were the not too subtle pieces of political and social commentary which echoed recent Spanish films, Platform and Cadaver.However, it's no accident that the entire plot of Squid Game revolves around the visually striking staircase that for us art school students of the 90s instantly recognised as the post-modern Memphis style. For me this was a kind nod to the 80s post modernist architectural tradition of borrowing other people's ideas and incorporating it into something new and visually striking.And that's the point at which I stopped caring that Squid Game was in essence a neo-postmodern composite and started enjoying the ride.And what a ride.No spoilers here but suffice to say every episode had me experience the full range of emotions, from dread and anger, sympathy and blood list for revenge, Squid Game is brilliantly crafted.The horror genre nerds might try to dismiss some part of the plot as being derivative, but every one needs to remember that Korean cinema doesn't care about genre.Seriously, take a day off work, order take away food and strap yourself in and watch the whole thing in one day. You won't regret it.\",\n",

But no, we get stealing from his mom, failure at the track, encounter with bookies...After that we\\'re introduced a pointless \"game\". Who runs that and to what end? The contestants are unknown so wagering makes no sense. Randomly killing losers makes no sense. Some kind of government thing makes no sense. Gladiator stories like Hunger Games or the Maze series work because the heroes are chosen for their skills. These people were chosen for their lack of skill. Huh?The acting is amateur at best. There isn\\'t one likable character. The ending was shoehorned in to allow for an unexpected season 2.This is so far from watchable for me on so many levels I can only assume I\\'m not the intended audience. I give it 0 stars, everyone else seems to give it 10. Call it five stars.',\n",

       "   'Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. Didn\\'t watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some \"Game\" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story. That didn\\'t exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode. The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you\\'re going through this ordeal alongside them. The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I\\'m looking at you Episode 6). The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.It also doesn\\'t hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you\\'d expect from a \"Game\" series. Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let\\'s just say some things get revealed and they are what you\\'d boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren\\'t good. Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. Good thing it doesn\\'t ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it\\'s heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess. Unless you\\'re squeamish and can\\'t handle rough stuff, I\\'d highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. Had a great time with it. Wherever they decide to take the story next, I\\'ll certainly am looking forward to it. And if I were to rate it, I\\'d give it an 8.5/10.',\n",
       "   'This show\\'s massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show\\'s multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that \"Squid Game\" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. \"Squid Game\" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like \"Pulp Fiction,\" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With \"Squid Game,\" you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it.',\n",

Camera work, color correction/editing & set design were AMAZING and the music was great.All that said, I don't think it's mind blowing. Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won't mind. Don't let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not. I think you should not miss out on it.

The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.',\n",

The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production. Also, I know it's pretty rare for Korean shows to have more than 1 season, but that ending was hinting at a 2nd season, wasn't it?\",\n",
       "   'While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don\\'t expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga \"Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji\", which has been running from 1996. It\\'s been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing \"Squid Game\".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this \"inspiration\".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. \"Squid Game\" definitely satisfies in this department, although it\\'s not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong\\'s \"Burning\" (2018) or the Oscar-winning \"Parasite\".

       "   \"The Good:I don't give 10s out lightly. Squid Game deserves this score because there is NOTHING else that came out in 2021 that became a cultural phenomenon like this one. No astroturfing, no manufactured hype. A genuine global phenomenon that emerged organically. How about that?Squid Game is television at its absolutely finest. I can't tell you the last time I was immediately transfixed by a show and captivated from beginning to end. Where do I even start with this?The incredible characters, who are more human and realistic than 99% of the people we ever see on screen? The incredible layered writing that gives each person such depth and complexity? The performances, which are so powerful and excellent, that the cast became overnight global celebrities? The pacing of the show which - save for episode 8 - is basically perfect? The twists and turns, shocking reveals and incredible easter eggs layered throughout? The tension generated from a brutal, misanthropic world that nevertheless has a twisted sense of morality and fairness? The iconic visuals? The set and costume design that keeps these images in your head long after you've seen the show?The exciting, diverse and incredible set pieces? How an episode about marbles - literally the least visually compelling game in the series - is universally declared one of the best episodes of television ever produced? Or how the first game grabs you and immediately sums up the ethos of the entire show?What about the heavy themes, which delve deep into explorations of human nature, greed, solidarity; that reflect contemporary anxieties about income inequality in South Korea (and increasingly, the world)? Hell, this and Parasite have solidified South Korea as a cultural superpower and honestly, if I were Korean, I would be extremely proud. The Korean Wave is going to be a tsunami.I can go on and on about what this show does well: how you can spend hours dissecting it, how it balances extremely dark and sadistic subject matter with humanity, tenderness and humour, how it subverts expectations the RIGHT WAY. It's a 10.The Bad: Perfection doesn't truly exist. And if I wanted to really pick out a flaw, it's Episodes 7 and 8. I'll touch on the VIPs after, but all-in-all, Episode 7 is still a great episode. It just adds some elements (like narration), that I didn't see as necessary. Episode 8 is an emotional wrecking ball, but it's weirdly short and kind of out of place.The Ugly: Okay, so the major criticism I've been seeing has been the performances and dialog of the VIPs. Notwithstanding the difficulty of finding fluent, non-Korean English speakers in South Korea, directing them (whilst not speaking the same language) and writing English dialog as a non-English speaker, the VIPs are highly intentional.Squid Game does not portray the wealthy upper class as an elite group of hyper sophisticated, intelligent people. This is probably a more realistic depiction: they're crude, callous, cringe inducing and save for their wealth, pathetic people. The casting of Gong Yoo and Lee Byung-Hun - who are basically Brad Pitt/Leo DiCaprio levels of famous in South Korea - was meant to imply that the wealthy retain these handsome, sophisticated men to project an elite status. But it doesn't exist. In reality, these are just douchebags.That the mind behind all of this is, well, the last person you'd expect, but in reality, would be the MOST LIKELY to do something like this, drives this point home even more.In summation. Either you've watched Squid Game or not at this point. It's a masterpiece. It's the best content I've seen all year. Just watch it and make up your own mind.\",\n",

The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?\",\n",

Such operation could not become unnoticed.I've noticed the cop's phone was about 60% charged at the beginning, so hiw did ge kept his battery until the end?The old man's identity was known to middle staff (soldiers), which didn't made much sense.In any case it's a good one and worth to check out.\",\n",

It is highly stylised and quite a few of the scenes come across as they've been taken straight out the pages of a graphic novel...all this means is that it looks great!Situations bring out the worst in people mostly, but also sometimes the best in people, as characters choose to work together or betray each other to make it to the end.

Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face.

       "   \"Series are wonderful ones to watch because they sow curious elements into the mind of the audience when they finish the episodes one by one. There was something striking in each episode that urges the viewers to go for the next one. Squid Game is similar to that, it is like a typical Web/TV series that has that flavor in every episode. I'm an ardent fan of Korean movies because of the way of representation and the choosing of subjects they are portraying. Squid Game is the first Korean series I am watching that also provides that kind of Korean fragrance. It's about games not only one game but also the children's game popular among in Korea. The basic core of the movie is the need for money and the problems and struggles followed by the low-class section of the Korean community. The series gets more engaged when the contestants participate in the game. And the game is something like a survival one because those who failed in the game will be killed. It is a do-or-die action for them. Initially, there were 456 contestants and when the game progresses the number gets decreased and the amount in the piggy bank becomes increases. When the last man survives he gets an amount of 45.6 billion won as a reward. This might be the capsule plot behind Squid Game. There might arise a lot of questions regarding this capsule plot. Who conducts these survival games? What did they get while conducting these games? Is it legal or illegal? Like this, you'll have many more doubts and questions regarding Squid Game. If you watched the series you'll have that clear answer with you and if you are not watched it yet then go and watch this wonderful series. You'll surely get engaged.\",\n",

The show is properly high budget , the acting is decent and the script is good, what makes the show appeal to masses, just like Lost when it came out, not many realized it's a rehashed for masses Earth 2.\",\n",

In the first stage, 456 people are invited to the game. We focus on 8 of them. The remaining 448 people will die simply extras. 5 of these 8 people are doing tricks to win the money.Even if we accept the logic of the script itself, allowing people to kill each other when the game is not being played.

It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly.

Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. You probably won't see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. The best thing about this series is the acting.

       "   'This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It\\'s a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You\\'ll understand why.And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).Overview:\\nThis series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It\\'s very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.The Good:\\nThe idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of \"Hunger Games\" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids\\' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It\\'s not the best character writing but it sure did the job.The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It\\'s all great, it\\'s what the series is meant to do.The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn\\'t do it for me).The Bad:\\nThe main character is kind of \"stale\" to me, it\\'s not really someone I\\'d care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It\\'s not about the actor, but the director didn\\'t really get so clever about managing his MC\\'s façade it felt flat.It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there\\'s not much to see after that.It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That\\'s what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn\\'t sign up for, nor did we want.The Ugly:\\nRemember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven\\'t seen him die but something about the entire side plot should\\'ve happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really cliché.VIPs: This is a grand \"kek\", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drinkNothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn\\'t buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that\\'s not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.Last game is a buzzkill: They should\\'ve come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn\\'t help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it\\'s still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever.',\n",
       "   'This one isn\\'t popular because it\\'s groundbreaking or going where television hasn\\'t been before, but because of the story it\\'s telling. Korean television/cinema has had a big boom among Western audiences in the last few years and I\\'m glad to see it because they do create wonderful media and are excellent storytellers. Squid Game, however, isn\\'t any different from what the Japanese offered us through Battle Royale some decades prior but given the current socio/political climate we\\'re living in, this show was released at just the right time.Ultimately, it\\'s a critique on capitalism and how it dehumanizes people. We see how far a person will go just to have a fat wallet. I think the show does a good job at tackling this topic by showing the negative effects this greed has on people. We see how some working class people get lost in their pursuit of insane wealth to the point of financial ruin and how some of the wealthy elite have so much money than they know what to do with so they decide to bet on working class people like one would do on horses - a comparison that is made in the show.The characters we follow who join the games are all in financial ruin and desperately need money to pay off their debts. The first episode gives us the backstory of the main protagonist, Gi-Hun and the second one gives us glimpses into the lives of the other main characters whom the show will focus on as the games progress. The initial antagonist character among them, the gangster guy, is your stereotypical bad guy. Bullying everyone in the facility, cheating, beating a guy to death - he meets all the \"bad guy is bad\" stereotypes. Our protagonist isn\\'t perfect but he has a good heart and seems to be one of only a few who has a decent moral compass. The latter being debatable with the choice he makes at the end, but we\\'ll get there in a moment.The way each episode is written, you know that Gi-Hun is going to end up winning the game no matter what. Although this irritated me a bit because of how predictable it was, they do manage to hit with shocks and surprises despite the obvious outcome. Since there are various main characters we were following, you begin to root for several of them, most notably Sae-Byeok, Ali, and Player 001. So when these characters lose the game, it does have an emotional impact to those who get invested in the story which seems to be everyone, really. In that respect, the show succeeds at making people feel something and at times left in shock despite how predictable. An interesting balance to strike but Squid Game does it. I don\\'t think anything sets the viewer up for the big plot twist at the end, sadly I was expecting it because it got spoiled for me - it\\'s hard not to have this show spoiled with how popular it is on social media. However, it is quite a big twist that actually really brings the critique at the center of this story home.Now my issues with this show have to do with it\\'s B plot and the awful VIP\\'s that were introduced near the end of the games. The B plot is that of a detective that sneaks his way onto the boat when the players decide to return and continue playing the game. He makes it pretty far in his mission to investigate and expose these sadistic games but the climax for this plot is very underwhelming. I guess the game master or head henchman turns out to be the detective\\'s brother and this revelation is what makes the detective give up, so he lets himself be shot and killed. Maybe they were trying to accomplish something with this plot, this one did manage to keep me in suspense and the ending upset me - while the predictable main plot kept me in some suspense but really got me with its ending. I suppose I\\'ll be further unpacking that one. It might not be that deep though and just be speedy storytelling when it comes to the B plot.Now for the complaint that seems to be everyone else\\'s, the awful VIP\\'s. I wouldn\\'t have an issue with the appearance of these characters if it wasn\\'t for the horrid way they were acted out. The voices were too irritating to hear, every time they came out and spoke, I felt like the minutes dragged on. The dialogue for them was awful too. Now it\\'s possible it was written by someone who\\'s first language isn\\'t English, but the actors (who I assume are native English speakers) couldn\\'t pitch in and amend that ? Well what can you expect from them when the acting was atrocious. I read online that the actors were asked to perform this way but intentional as it may be, it was irritating and really dragged down the show in my opinion. They were a cheesy addition to the show. I get they\\'re necessary to the plot, but had they been performed differently, in a less \"1960\\'s cartoon villain\" way then they would\\'ve been on par with the rest of the show. I think speaking in normal voices and saying sentences that normal people say, would\\'ve made it much more sadistic. I mean that\\'s the theme throughout the show.All in all, I enjoyed the series. I wasn\\'t fond with the ending showing the character deciding to go back and expose the game, instead of going to see his kid - and he\\'s the hero we were supposed to root for ? Guess that\\'s to set us up for season 2, but I think this show works better if there\\'s new characters each season and if they must bring back the main character, he could come back after taking care of important things. Still, I will definitely be watching season 2 when it\\'s available. Believe it or not I\\'m actually happy this is as popular as it is, it means people are becoming more aware of the reality we\\'re living in.',\n",

       "   'One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother\\'s card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.Unfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don\\'t feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game.Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.',\n",
       "   \"I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful.\",\n",
       "   'After finishing the show today (I braced myself not to watch it all in one sitting) and without reading spoilers (but recognising many of the hints), I think this show is liked and disliked for the wrong reasons by many.I don\\'t know what Koreans think of the show, but have quite a few Asian friends who liked it. It\\'s always been a bit funny to me, because most Asians I know NEVER seem interested in their continents movies or shows and prefer Hollywood.Personally, I think Hollywood is about as bad as it can be (at least I hope it can\\'t get even worse) and there\\'s almost nothing for me.Since the late 90s, Japan and Korea (also Brazil and Mexico) have done quite a few amazing movies.Korea with Brotherhood, OldBoy, the brilliant Shiri/Swiri, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and the very twisty \"The Wailing\" (Squid Game reminded me of that, although they are about different topics),\\nJapan with gems like Swallowtail Butterfly, Love Exposure, Confessions, to name only a few.Many of the mediocre or bad reviews complain about things that show that they never watched Asian movies and can\\'t seem to get into the culture.One example is the character of Min-Yeo.Sure, on the surface, she\\'s a manipulative lady, seemingly just cruel and selfish. But I was rather shocked to see how many people consider her to be just as bad as the gangster.The actress gave an interview and said she actually felt very bad for her character and that her character, though nasty and feisty is actually just very afraid and alone. We can see that in her own way, how she wants to \"belong\". Think how she learned to use her body or anything to \"entice\" men. Such behavior is usually learned from a traumatic childhood. I really would have loved to know her backstory and hope we will get to know more about her in season 2.I actually didn\\'t hate ANY of the characters. Many said they couldn\\'t sympathize or like any of the characters, but I didn\\'t feel that way. Good or bad, they all had their two sides. The only exceptions are probably Daek-Su and the VIPs, but they are that way for a reason. Heck, there were times in the beginning when I even felt a little bad for Daek-Su.I think Squid Game is trying to show us that we are all neither good or bad people by nature. It\\'s our actions that make us either good or bad.Comparisons to movies like the Hunger Games (yuk!) or Battle Royale don\\'t seem very fitting. One reviewer mentions Oldboy, but I don\\'t see that either. Oldboy and the trilogy around it is about revenge. Squid Game is NOT about revenge. It\\'s more about human nature and how chasing after money is not fulfilling and that money does NOT bring us happiness.Don\\'t you think most of these characters would gladly forfeit all that money if they could bring back the people they lost? Our hero sure doesn\\'t seem happy about his winnings.And Battle Royale... it\\'s similar in a sense that it pits everyone vs everyone, but it\\'s all about punishment. Squid Game isn\\'t about punishment either. Nobody is forced to participate. Heck, even before they cross the glass bridge or any other game, the players ALWAYS have the option to call it quits. It\\'s their greed or desperation that keeps them going. And in some cases, their lack of perspective.Although the big twists are not really a surprise if you watch out for some hints that give them away, I think this has been a very good show. I think the reason it\\'s been so successful is that although it is almost \"normal\" for Korean or Asian movies to \"not end happy\", Western audiences aren\\'t used to it. Surely had this been an American show, the hero wouldn\\'t have learned anything and just spent the money and have a sugary happy ending.The fact that it doesn\\'t end in such a \"perfect\" (and thus unnatural) way is why I like Asian storytelling more. It\\'s just more like actual life.',\n",
       "   \"A nice drama but with bad unrealistic endings in the last 2/9 episodes. The VIPs are rotten wasting stories!The starting is smooth nice to the middle but as it get long, it became average interesting only. If they did not conclude so so simply made endings, I will give 9/10. I can only give 8/10 which is considered good to watch.

       "   \"First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless.\",\n",

       "   \"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it.\",\n",
       "   '*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants\\' lives.Now, that\\'s all well and good. Who doesn\\'t love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would\\'ve made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn\\'t the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that\\'s it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don\\'t worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what\\'s his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn\\'t even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he\\'s only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN\\'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT\\'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder \"How bad are things in South Korea right now?\" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn\\'t actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn\\'t write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren\\'t bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I\\'m just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don\\'t understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn\\'t even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn\\'t you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it\\'s damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let\\'s do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun\\'s gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I\\'m getting tired at this point, so I\\'ll just leave it at that.If you don\\'t give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that\\'s something that interests you, watch an episode or two.',\n",
       "   'I think any review and ratings for movies is reflective of the theme of this series itself. Is this series worth 10? Clearly no. But many will give it 10 for 2 reasons.1) Gore addicts. 2) Go with the hype.In a clear objective analysis. This series started out extremely good, original, and with very deeply moving and captivating backstories. However by about mid point, like many other series, they ran out of ideas and became cliche, just another Hunger Game, Saw, etc... remake.That being said, for the first part at least, I would give it a 10. The 2nd 1/2, is clearly a 5 and a balance of 7 to 7.5. Rounding down because of certain plot holes and inconsistencies which I will address here.1) Most of the game staff\\'s reactions through the series were puzzling and inaccurate. Everyone signed a contract and death waiver, so technically speaking, everything they were doing was legal. So why were they afraid of the police? Why overly secret? The scene when the front man realized a police was in his office, he pulled out a gun to hunt him. Why? They technically did nothing wrong. If anything, pulling out a gun to threaten the police made them wrong.This was clearly demonstrated in episode 2 that they even allowed the players to vote out of playing. They had no fear of any legal repercussion, yet then why rest of the series they were so worried about it? It is an error in their fundamental logic of the script.2) A lot of Koreans preached about how this is a series addressing income inequality in South Korea, maybe the whole capitalist world. Yet, in the film, every single player was there for a reason and not because they were victims. The main protagonist himself gambled away his money, despite having bad luck in the employment. He may not have a luxurious life, but his massive debt came from gambling and borrowing money from loan sharks.His best friend was even worse, a white collar criminal that embezzled from his clients, created fraudulent documents, etc... from \"bad investments.\" Cough cough, you mean pyramid schemes? From his character throughout the series, he was not a moral man, and revealed to be a psychopath. So he was there despite the fact he was not from the lower part of the wealth range.3) The night time massacre scene was either one of the most brilliant writing in this series or the worst, depending on whether it was intentional by the writers. What am I talking about?Either the writers blundered and just wrote in this cliche plot line of how people will turn on each other for money, to survive, and what not. Or ... it was deliberate to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the game system.Throughout the game, the gamer staff dictated an \"equal\" environment of 2nd chance, not only so, but one heavily and meticulously kept accountable. When they found out 1 player was cheating with the staff, they were eliminated and made examples of. Not only so, they observed their 3 fundamental rules so tightly, they even allowed them to vote out the game in episode 2.So the riot scene was out of place, either as a writers\\' blunder again in the inconsistency of the script, or it was brilliantly put in to demonstrate the hypocrisy of their so called game. They claim to have strict equal rules, even a democratic process, but in the end, used monetary incentive, greed, and starvation to thin the herd when necessary and to turn the players against each other rather than against the game staff. Players were suppose to play the games and be eliminated through the games, not murdered in their sleep. There was no accountability when that 1st man was murdered and as such created hostile environment rather than the promise of fair play.All of the sudden, the chance to vote out as a majority disappeared as the players were no longer divided into 2 groups, yes and no, but into multiple self-interested groups. This is... the heart of socialism, which might all along be the author\\'s intent.If it is... it is brilliantly done. Why?Take a step back and look at all 9 episodes. This is what it means then.In the capitalist world, there are winners and losers, there is a wealth gap. What socialism does, is preach to those who failed in the capitalist world, by their own hands, and a promise of a \"2nd chance,\" a better system, under the pretense of equality, a democratic process, accountability, and social order.However, in reality, all of this was done at gun point and the people, though voluntarily there, were there without choice because their alternative is go back to their failed life in the capitalist system. The socialist system itself is a deception, instead of order, they actually created chaos and pits people against people through greed, starvation, and manipulation. The people, which originally had a choice to democratically end it, then becomes enemies towards each other, losing sight of the real enemy that put them there in the first place. In the end, even if you win in a socialist system, like the protagonist, you really lose. The only real winners? Are the socialist creators.This is socialism\\'s core, what happened in many countries throughout history such as North Korea, China, Venezuela, and what is happening now in many western worlds, including the USA.',\n",

Which is to say, If u can\\'t stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it\\'s not something original and groundbreaking.

Once I'd started this series I couldn't stop as I just needed to know what was happening next! This show just keeps you hooked and I love it.

The sound and visuals are pretty solid.When it comes down to the writing it's a bit of a rollercoaster as there are good and bad things there as well. I didn't really like the characters and some of the games presented were poorly thought out in terms of the rules and the characters didn't notice these issues which then made them act stupid.The ending of season 1 is rather open and like with many shows leaves room for a season 2. The question is whether or not they can make season 2 also interesting because I think we have seen the best twists the show has to offer in the first season.Also looking at the shows as a whole I can get behind the message it tries to deliver even with the problems.\",\n",

You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters.

She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of.

       "   'I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies. Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me. But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. And boy! It has paid back. I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher. It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.The show is full of metaphors. It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society. Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too.Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam. There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie. But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning. The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating. The script is tight, gripping and addictive. The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. The music matches with the spirit of the show. The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now. Be a player, watch Squid Game.My Rating - 9.5 out of 10.',\n",

       "   \"Squid Game is an interesting and rather gruesome show about a group of financially troubled Korean adults who agree to play a sequestered group a children's games in order to compete for a large cash prize. Little do they know that there is a substantial price for losing, and they soon find themsevles in a sort of Korean style Hunger Games. The main characters engage in a protracted struggle for survival--once the players agree to play, they are not allowed to leave unless a majority of the players agree to end the game. Spurred on by greed (the prize is over 20 million US dollars) most agree to play on to the finish.This series is quite entertaining, but thematically owes much to other recent last-person-standing movies like Battle Royale and Hunger Games. This show is interesting because the characters are trapped not so much by their social class as in the Hunger Games, but rather by their bad decisions that result in their financial desperation. In that sense, the show seems to hold up a mirror to what society tends to do to people--set them in competition with each other and then severely punish the losers. The games are conceptually very ingenious and produce both suspense and interesting moral dilemmas. There's also a number of interesting subplots that I won't give away as spoilers.Squid Game is a pretty entertaining and addictive watch, but beware, it is really violent. There is plenty of suspense and some good characters, so much to enjoy if you are into this genre.\",\n",

That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial.

       "   'Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (\"would you rather\" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of \"red light, green light\" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they\\'re playing children\\'s games, and why it\\'s all happening, might offer some comfort, but it\\'s all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the \"equality\" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it\\'s so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they\\'re badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.',\n",
       "   \"I just started this series. I'll finish because the story is excellent. Good characters, good drama, thought provoking...all the makings of a stellar viewing experience.But in my whole life....the English dubbing on this is THE WORST and it totally takes away from the excellence of the overall story. I only speak English, and I'm finding myself taking mental notes of the million different better ways this could have been translated to make it more compelling. Seriously, the English in this series is like porn dialogue. Who at Netflix thought this translation mess was ok? Do better Netflix.\",\n",
       "   'The first five episodes are thoroughly entertaining, fast-paced, and establish each character in a sufficiently believable-if a bit hollow-way.From episode 6 onward, the characters become real human beings and the emotion hits HARD. The stakes become real and gripping. I loved it.There are several holes in the story that are never explained, but with this being a continuing series, there will be opportunity for them to fix that.This is far deeper than I was expecting.',\n",
       "   \"Finally after so much hypes and promotions over Social media platforms I have binge watched this Squid Games season 1 during this weekend. First of all this movie shows us the perfect examples of Human behaviors that too in a very practical way. The character development of this show is top notch and the set design/locations was tremendously great. The screenplay was good but I think it was dragged a bit to showcase the Game scenes and players emotions during gameplay which was good actually.Actually we have already watched this kind of concepts earlier so nothing new in it except those +ve points mentioned in above paragraph. It's wholesome bloodsheds allover this show so it's better if you're 16+ then you can go for it. It have also a little sexual intercourse scene was there for around 40-45Sec so better to avoid watching with senior family members ; of course you can go with your brothers/sisters if they're comfortable with these little scenes.And Finally I will rate it 6 out of 10 Stars from my side, because for me it's just a One Time Watch kind of season. You can go for it... It's worth spending time if you wanna enjoy a show during your leisure time.\",\n",
       "   'Just a thrilling series. The camera work,sets just beautiful,amazing acting. It keeps you wanting more. At the end we all where VIPS to the Squid Games.',\n",
       "   \"Even after that atrocious second episode I'd recovered some interest and intrigue in the various plot-lines. I rated it a steady 7/10 and then the penultimate episode dropped me to a 6/10 then the last episode was awful: dead mum, red hair, pointless and unsatisfying twist with the old man. I mean, come on! If he wanted some people to play these old games with why not organise a tournament where no-one dies and everyone has a fun, happy time competing for the money? And the red hair - wtf? And the money - the old dear who has this adopted son foisted on her is going to agonise over spending those billions because she thinks it's for Cho Sang-woo.I'm just gutted that the series played out the way it did becuase up to that point it was OK. Really though it never lived up to the tension of the set-up and the consequences of the first game.My conclusion to all this - Netflix have a brilliant marketing departmnet and they know how to dial the right dials even when the product isn't that great, or original.\",\n",
       "   \"It wasn't until episode of the VIPs that I changed to have its original language and subtitles. This totally changed my view of the entire series and I may have to go back and rewatch it particularly because of the poor dubbing in English which the text wasn't bad, it was the inflection and tone that was obnoxious.The last episode is profound and leaves an open for a second series. There is still confusion in my mind over the detective/brother plot line.\",\n",
       "   'The was a fun, fascinating show that was more emotional than I ever expected it to be but also not as violent as I was expecting either. There is some brutal violence but extremely tolerable unless you are squeamish.Many of the characters you will feel a connection to even if they aren\\'t in the main cast. There are some you will enjoy getting their \"come up\\'ins\" to a satisfying end. The choices the lead characters make will enrage you and make you despise them but the backstory given to those characters will also make you understand why they do/did the things they do/did.There isn\\'t much in the way of surprises (except the hair, if you\\'ve finished you know what I mean) but there are some decent plot twists that may catch you off guard. The 6 games themselves, many across the world will know or may have even done; some you\\'ll be like \"really?\". All are brutal by design. This is worth the watch and dubbing in English didn\\'t look or sound as bad as it could have.',\n",

It really bugs me that American audiences find this to be so \"unique\". This concept has been used in many plots... for a long time... Especially in Asian cinema. So everyone should just relax.Still, this is a pretty great series. I just feel sorry for anyone that has to watch the last episode...',\n",

       "   'This is a simple formula that has been done to death \"poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch\". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like \"it\\'s an study of human nature\" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it\\'s environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let\\'s face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke.',\n",
       "   \"The problem with a mini series that starts out as good as this one is, it's really hard to keep the same intensity for eight more episodes.

The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise.',\n",
       "   'Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.',\n",
       "   'The acting is absolutely atrocious throughout with the possible exception of the female lead who\\'s a South Korean model turned actress and one or two others. The main female antagonist is one of the worst actors I\\'ve ever seen...ever, she overacts to the point that I was waiting for her head to explode and I cheered when she finally bought it so I wouldn\\'t be subjected to any more of her \"acting\". And even allowing for the dubbing the dialogue is often worse than the acting, corny, cheesy, very dated. And I found the main character to be too much of a loser, to the point that while I knew I was supposed to, I felt no sympathy for him at all. Because all of his problems were completely self-inflicted and he continued to be a loser through the entire series...I just didn\\'t care about him.There are plot holes wide enough to drive a truck through. Like the police detective who manages to infiltrate the island and fool everyone even though there\\'s security everywhere and the guards are computer coded. And lets not even mention how he was able to follow the van from about 30 yards back and then move around on the ferry without anyone seeing him....and I guess I missed the reasoning behind the Front Man being his brother and killing him....And yet.... I couldn\\'t stop watching it....because the writing is incredible, especially compared to the absolute drek coming out of Hollywood these days. And while the acting leaves something to be desired the characters are refreshingly realistic in the way they react to what\\'s happening around them. There are no heroics, no women who can kick the ass of a guy twice their size, no men who end up figuring a way out of the mess they\\'re in. There are just real people dealing with a horrific situation the way actual real live people would, not the way what passes for real people in Hollywood do. The emotions are raw, the situations are brutal and the good guys don\\'t always win because at the end of the day there aren\\'t any good guys...just people trying to survive but not giving a thought to what it\\'s costing them to do it. Episode six was the absolute high point of the series, it felt like a gut punch while I was watching it, how often can you say that about a mainstream series or movie these days? That episode was some of the best drama, some of the best writing I\\'ve seen in many years and I think it will stay with me for some time.Sorry to say that they couldn\\'t really maintain it after that. The resolution of the cops story line was lame and I\\'m not even sure why he was there at all. I\\'m sure there\\'s something I missed about why his brother, the Front Man, killed him but.... I missed it. The rich spectators were lame; basically tired cliché\\'s.And the end just kind of fizzled. I know a lot of people think the main character evolved during the games and came out a different person but I have to disagree. He was a loser at the beginning and still one at the end. The old man had a very good point in the final episode, every player was there by choice, they all left and, already knowing what it entailed, made the decision to return. Yet the main character seems to want to blame everyone else for his trauma, the old man, the people running the game, everyone except himself because nothing is ever his fault. He hasn\\'t changed, he makes a half-assed attempt to do right by his promise to the female player by getting her brother and dropping him off with his friends mother but he apparently abandon\\'s the girls mother in the north and in the end fails his own daughter...yet again because he\\'d rather wallow in guilt and his own self-inflicted misery that try to move on. He\\'s still a loser....just a rich one.Squid Game is yet another version of a very old and well worn story, the difference is that it made the characters into real people who dealt with what was happening around them the way real people would. That\\'s what makes it better than other versions of the same story. And it makes it light years better than any of the drek being churned out by Hollywood these days. Even with it\\'s flaws I highly recommend it. Just be prepared to be emotionally beaten up by it!',\n",

It\\'s hard to connect with the story and the actors when they\\'re expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from \"actors\" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could\\'ve been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn\\'t fun (and we\\'ve seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring.',\n",
       "   \"I have been very greatly entertained by this series. I would have given it a 10 but I took a point off because of the poor acting from the VIP's and the ending that seemed rushed. I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one. I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end. The subtitles can also be improved. Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film.All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises. It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it. The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way. I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre. The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed. It is very important to any movie. Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9. You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings. All the main characters did a great job. I like the mixture of different types of people. Definitely recommend.\",\n",
       "   '68/100I finally decided to finishe this show after being on my list for months. I don\\'t have much to say other than to highlight the inconsistency of the script of its episodes, which became extremely annoying after a few chapters.For instance, episode 6 is easily the best episode of the entire series. Right after, you are introduced to one of the worst; it\\'s almost as if you have to reward those moments when Squid Game truly shows its innovation. That\\'s why the ending, although disappointing, I can\\'t be surprised at the fact that it was executed in such a way.Speaking of whether or not this series is truly innovative, it definitely has its own quirky streak, one that the series isn\\'t afraid to exploit almost 100%. Many times these moments may not work for me taking into account the contrasting contextualization that the program possesses but, one way or another, it\\'s still appreciated.Impressive performances by the cast but that can be affected once certain new characters enter.The only thing that really remained throughout the program was its technical aspects. It got to a point where I was blown away by some of the editing decisions the series would make. They would seem simple, but they are refreshing to see for a series with so many \"action\" scenes.Squid Game fully understood how to stand out, which is why it will become one of the most remembered shows in the coming years. However, popularity never meant quality, and this might be the best example of that saying yet.',\n",

I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I stuck it out until the end and was completely let down. By far, the worst finale of any series in history.',\n",

       "   \"Very well done production. It was like a modern day Twilight Zone. Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.But definitely watch it.\",\n",

Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion.\",\n",

I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?\",\n",

The key is in what the players weren\\'t told, not what they were: 456 competitors may enter, but only one will exit alive at the end. These Tattersalls denizens don\\'t compete, except to bet on the \"horses\" performances... & deaths.SG asks its viewers if they believe humans are good. Not quite, right? I was yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races.

We can easily decode what the writer is announcing b/c varied Numerology websites are fairly consistent. While the definitions, as in astrology, tend to be generalized so as to broaden the application, let\\'s jump in to see if any of the player\\'s #s are messages to viewers.>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & #456 signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach a #456 how work harder on oneself and add value to life. 456 picked up 001 as a gganbu trainer, evincing that, plainly, moral fortitude is no prerequisite.>218 is Cho Sang-woo, 456\\'s \\'friend\\' who worked up from the \\'hood,\\' to being a whilte-collar hood. To a point, he mirrors 001. This loathsome in-runner surprisingly gave up the fight, but not before becoming a murderer. #218 is for manifesting one\\'s biggest & on the face, near impossible desires (💰) into reality. Business, duality, & serving humanity must coexist. 218 knows that 456 will serve his mother AND humanity w/ the 💰. 218 failed in his run to win that💰, but he found redemption in his last moments.>067 is Kang Sae-byeok, from NK, who strives to protect her family. No surprise: #067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, responsibility, sacrifice & service. Creating a solid foundation for the future, & protection of family & possessions is a #067\\'s priority.>001, the old man, is most positive when pacing for work. #001 is, recognition for 1st place; it represents independence, but can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su. A #101\\'s primary function is romance, w/ importance of relationships right behind. At first blush this doesn\\'t fit w/ the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic trist. Let\\'s flesh it out further.A #101 needs coexistence. Without it, a #101 is alone. People w/ that # can feel lonely & lost just thinking of being alone. 101 obviously grew up w/o basic needs & training, leaving him consumed w/ bitterness & ill-prepared for rigid competition. #101 also points to eternity & the journey that is about to begin w/all its uncertainties. It\\'s a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny, God is, so #101s should follow the course & learn before their time on this plane is over. It\\'s sad to think that 101 didn\\'t get emotional support or the care needed for success. He is still responsible for his infractions, but it\\'s sad, none the less. He parallels the VIP who was attracted to the cop. They both had the same expression of shock, disbelief, & the beginnings of acceptance, when facing death.>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst upsets of the show. #199s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda. For Ali it\\'s providing for his family - independently. A #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict w/ humanity\\'s survival & long-term well-being. We see that Ali is good, albeit naive, & foolish to be so independent that he\\'d wager his life on a long shot to try & provide for his family.>212 is Han Mi-nyeo, the \\'crazy Mare\\' who brought down 101. #212s frequently chase curiosity & adventure, and ALL new, shiny objects, often on a whim. #212s can be good team member & their energy can be sensual. Jumping the fence may lead to negative outcomes. Enroute towards goals, they can face harsh obstacles. An add\\'l similarity to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them. Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements w/in themselves. They portray ruthlessness, but there is a forlornless about them, too.>111 is the doctor. A #111 won\\'t let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership. They haven\\'t been broken. If #111\\'s thoughts are negative, it could attract toxic situations & people.>240 is just released from prison for putting down her abusive \\'sire\\', \\'Philly\\' Ji-yeong. #240 is about nurture & mutual support w/ a high focus on security & the future, all provided without expectation of return. She went underfoot for 067, & thus negated the lie the VIP\\'s tell themselves about human nature. Having already sacrificed her freedom to deliver justice to her mother, 067 is the moral center of the show.>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement can be phenomenal in a #244\\'s life. He must keep wrong at bay & not offend the inner energy installed by his maker.>The husband/wife duo is portrayed in #69, or two identical digits facing & complimenting each other to make a whole. If we squeeze 6&9 together we can make an 8, which, toppled, is the eternity sign. In addition, the visual aspect of the # is related to ying&yang. The energy of #69 is best when involved directly w/family or team as an equal. Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for traumatic phase. Whether ending good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change. Be prepared for it, b/c the the manner in which it\\'s dealt with will effect one\\'s future.Finally, upon the runners\\' return, in EP3, 187 players re-enter the stalls: The US police code for murder.Getting chills?Oh, these \"poor,\" rich, hacked-up GOONS.

These reprobates can\\'t seem to notice through all the haze of pride, that people are most gratified when we help others.001 didn\\'t get what he wanted by hosting SG, which was a panecea for loneliness & boredom. It seems he & the VIPs justify their actions by deluding themselves that they are conducting a social experiment - Reassuring themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as they, leads to pitting people against each other. This enables them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: \\'Just look at who they really are! It\\'s voluntary... Anyway, they all get a fair chance.\\'In the end, the old man had the whole world, but was utterly unsatisfied. Craving the comraderie he\\'d had while growing up poor, he felt that kinship w/ 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him. At the time, 456 even had a second chance. He could have done the all-or-nothing, but refused. That plot point of betrayal, while needed, was his worst moment. The old man was playing him all day to tempt him, but he meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy.The kinship manifests itself when the old man wants to see HIM at the end of his life. 456 is there, bedside, when #1 dies. Where\\'s his wife? Where\\'s his kids?? Where\\'s his grandkids??? Can I get a mistress? Nope. Just 456 & an aid were there. Next, 001 saves 456\\'s \\'life\\' a second time, by jerking 456\\'s bit toward living, rather than merely existing.456 is who he is. He wins 3x\\'s in the show\\'s run, but even when he wins, he\\'s a pathetic loser that barely stumbles over the line. In winning, his soul was put-down. When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he again, didn\\'t get what he wanted, as 001 died before 456 could kill him. It did wake 456 up. He no longer has to feel guilty about flashing a laser in the old man\\'s eyes during the race: His regret is not shipping 001 off to the dog food plant himself.The red hair broadcasts that he\\'s now either on fire, or starting to blaze his trail. Finally. This is not over. We need a season 2. The question has not been answered yet. #456 is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. Here\\'s my ante-post bet & hope: In S2, he\\'ll be stallion #789 who tramples out the ghoulish fraternity of gamers.Quote:\\nGood rain knows when to fall -Du Fu-IMHO~>\\n🎭8 🎬8 🤔8⚡8🎨7🔚9\\nFor age 15+',\n",
       "   'SG is another foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable. If there\\'s no umpire, they will always run offsides. It is a display of the mutual annihilation pact we enter when it\\'s \"every man for himself.\"This eventing builds on \\'The Most Dangerous Game\\' with a twist. Here, bored, specialized multipliers of their own net worth, devise a game in which they entice impoverished souls who are in a asset-liability crisis to come out & play. We all know that money isn\\'t everything, but it sure fills in divets so the race of life will run smoothly.Instead of the fulsome, rebrobate 1%ers participating in the contest, they prefer to spectate from the comfort of their big screens, or private luxury box, while the \"horses\" perform... & die.Do YOU believe humans are good? Not quite, right?SG had me yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races. It not necessarily that all the players are horror-movie-stupid, but rather, many didn\\'t disern quickly enough how the \"game\" was metamorphosing into ruthless savagery. I tried to plead with them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the word \"NO!\" Augh! The players do soon understand that the only rules that apply are the ones that they are explicitly given by the referees. The penalties for running out of the basepaths are, Umm... Severe.The first two episodes focus on the wild swings 456 experiences when his journey begins. We watch 456 enter a limo, awake to a surreal psychotropic trip in the lofty dorm of horse stalls (300ft high, maybe?) & finally exit into the calamitous onslaught of Game 1.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the author stated his purpose: \"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life.\" He was building on his own experience of financial irons that kept his account in the red. The script is a metaphor for his own monetary gauntlet.For those of you who are new to Korean programming: Hey! We\\'ve been waiting for you;) Just relax, you should achieve your subtitle fitness almost immediately. The whole world is watching our entertainment deposits that way. If you can\\'t diversify, they win!K-dramas excel at withdrawing every possible wince & gasp out of the viewer. In general, the writing, directing, acting, & overall play are consistently supplying returns on investment due to the high quality of execution. So much so, that they\\'re in danger of their stats being overlooked. Korea\\'s got talent.SG is more of the same. It is superb dressage, or pagentry. This particularly applies to the horror genre, which is loaded with dumbed down characters& dialogue, lots more blood& guts, & an extraordinarily evil feel to the substandard works. A de-worming & thorough muck-out is in order. SG blows the whistle on those foul circulations. The violence is jolting, but not gratuitous or meaningless. There is a message for us.Yet, K-Dramas, like Simone Biles, can twist professionally, with beautiful strength. K-Dramas spiral the knife into the viewer\\'s psyche with disciplined follow-through. The absolute demented sickness of using the innocent color pink, with other pseudo-cheerful colors, (that also resemble many medicines, such as Pepto Bismal) plus the kiddie trappings (such as the giant doll) is all nauseating. It a dread multiplier.K-dramas also tend to drop players on the audience that are the most extremes of themselves in the beginning of the shoot. A multi-episode show allows ample time to invest in talent to improve performance & yield gains. Just remember that most of the people you see on the screen will either dramatically transform, or the audience\\'s appreciation of them will change, as the series matures. You may squander your currency backing a failing commodity, while another\\'s performance might lead your fantasy team to victory. 456 is pathetically & painfully a substandard performer of the worst sort: over 40, living with mom, swiping her money to go gambling on horses... Has he ever been bullish? Not likely. He\\'s thoroughly contemptible, & relegated to the penny stocks. I was aggravated at the thought of up to 9 innings/episodes monitoring his performance. It was doubtful he would gain any interest.Every competing \"horse\" has a number. If Korean screen writers assign numbers to jerseys, or saddlepads, it\\'s likely said numbers have a commodity backing their values in Numerology- This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to forensically decode what the writer is announcing in the stadium. Definitions in Numerology, like astrology, tend to be generalized. This broadens the applications, & provides a utitly player that can rebound into several positions. Having said that, Let\\'s see if any of the numbers the author assigned have any credit values...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things. Hard work will add value to life.Check. It\\'s applicable.>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456\\'s friend from the \\'hood.\\' The number 218 symbolizes manifesting one\\'s biggest & seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to wealth.>001, the old man\\'s # is at its most positive when in the realm of work. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>199 is Abdul Ali. 199\\'s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali, is providing for his family on his own. #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival & well-being.Check, check, check, again. And on it goes.Getting chills? If not, you probably haven\\'t seen the show yet. Just wait until you do. The strategy trotted out is medal-winning. Just be woke about what the show is about. It is not about displaying incidental, cheap, & meaningless horror for the purposes of titillation. SG is a metaphor for the writer\\'s own hardships in a cruel, uber competitive & heartless society. The players all represent the downtrodden, like geldings in irons.Most of their backstories, if broadcasted on GoFundMe, would get scouted for assistance. I\\'d be tempted to contribute to several of them. Even the criminals are subtley shown to have been wedged into their life choices. Delving into one gangster\\'s number (101) exposes his basic needs that clearly weren\\'t met in his life. It played a role in his projected gains & losses.K-dramas are also wont to lob surprises, or deferred options the viewer didn\\'t account for, into the works. Expect that not everything is what it seems to be. Avoid being roped in by Ponzi Schemes.This is not over. We need a season two. The question has not been answered yet. 456\\'s number is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. To the extent that he accomplishes anything, true to form, he would barely get a neck over the line. Heres my ante-post bet & hope: In season 2, he\\'ll be the stallion that tramples the game runners as a #789.Apologies for mixing monetary, equestrian, & sports metaphors over here. I\\'m not good with rules either.Quote:\\nGood rain knows when to fall. ~Du Fu~I also did a spoiler review.🎭8.5 🎬8.5 🤔8⚡8🎨7🔚9.',\n",
       "   'You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...\"Can money buy you happiness?\". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN\\'s exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There\\'s just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long).',\n",

And the last episode was half as long! Underwhelming.',\n",

       "   \"I put it on my watchlist because I absolutely love korean thrillers. I love the style and the type of writing the screenplay of almost every korean thriller and drama. Then I went to vacation and when I came back the hype about this series was incredible. I hope that more people love korean movies and series now as much as I do. Very nice, didn't disappointed and is as good as I expected when putting it on my watchlist.\",\n",

       "   \"Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.\",\n",
       "   'As a Korean series, it was good actually. Good acting from the Korean actors, but foreigners? NO, It was extremely bad as you feel that they are just reading what they have to say\\nAnyways, it takes eight for all.',\n",
       "   'After \"Liar Game\" and \"Alice in Borderland\" we have \"Squid game\".Some parts have been gruesome and to much fo me but thank God it\\'s on Netflix and I could skip :).Marbles game was so emotional that I have cried a little and I\\'m not ashamed to admit it.Very happy to have binge watch it.PS. Gong Yoo from \"Train to Busan\" or Goblin has also a short appearance among many other known actors from K-dramas.',\n",
       "   \"Kind of the same thing as Alice in borderland except the motives, characters, and drama are done much better. I also like that most of the characters are adults with relatable issues. I'm tired of teen drama. Take note Netflix you got a winner here.\",\n",
       "   \"After a couple of episodes I thought I wouldn't last to the end of the series. But it became oddly compulsive, and by about half way you definitely want to know how it all ends.But it is not that great. There is a lot of repetitiveness in the story, and it is drawn out over rather too many episodes.Moderate acting, but the main character was good.If you are looking for something different, well worth a try - as long as you can tolerate extreme violence.\",\n",
       "   \"Yes this can be seen as a dystopian fiction. Like Maze Runner, Hunger games, you name it. But the fact that they put children's games into the mix was a concept that was pulled off very well and in a way that made you feel a major amout of tension. I can only hope that this gets renewed for Season 2. If not then it had a hell of a run.\",\n",
       "   \"You know, not that bad considering overhype. Ephemera, no more, but has a good picture, music and let's say not so banal development of events( of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer, but for most series and viewers), let's say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement (usually it is so). Strongest side of this series is an acting, it is really solid. I think, considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as 1.\",\n",
       "   \"It started slower than I had anticipated, but I understand it's because they want the viewers to get to know one of the main characters a bit more. The games themselves are fun, yet sometimes sad to watch.....you will know what I mean when you get to the marbles game......no spoilers here! The show gets better as the episodes go on and I found myself rooting for a few of the participants. It's a fun show to watch, but the cruelty of humankind is just insane. The lengths people will go to survive is real and sad. I watched with subtitles because dubbing is always terrible and takes away from the characters in my opinion. Overall, I would recommend this show as it's very different from anything out there and after episode 3, keeps you in your seat.\",\n",
       "   'The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a \"battle royale\" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn\\'t matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a \"good heart\" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don\\'t matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are \"forced\" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, \"we can win this with everyone still alive\". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a \"final boss\" enemy in the show.I won\\'t spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of \" saw that coming\" and \"give me a break\" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.',\n",

       "   \"Started well. But mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. The games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. The ending was horrible and vague.It shows that losers will be losers even after winning. Just not relevant in today's world.\",\n",
       "   'Very similar to \"The Running Man\" (1987) in plot, although it plays more like \"Battle Royale\" (2000) and \"The Belko Experiment\" (2016).The whole story starts with a broken loser getting contacted by a guy that knows absolutely everything about him (in an almost supernatural way.) He invites him to play a game, which would reward a humongous amount of money to the winners (if there are more than one winner, the money is divided amongst them, inciting them to try to win alone.)When playing the first game, though, the players find out that losing means dying (or getting killed!) Obviously, people freak out and a lot of them die immediately. After that, people vote to go back home, without any prize.Episode 2 is dedicated to show the survivors that their lives are hell on earth, so many of them decide to go back into the game. That was at the same time the best episode of the whole series and the worst: a whole episode filled with fabricated drama, to built backgrounds for many characters, which prove to be absolutely meaningless later on, because the story simply ignores their psychological profiles and life baggage, making them act and react at the necessity of the plot.Key characters\\' personalities change \"sides\" just too many times along the series, at the will of the writer. For instance, the protagonist starts as a jerk, stealing money from his mother (for gambling, nonetheless,) then becomes a soft-hearted man, trying to connect with his daughter and save everybody, then becomes a jerk again, trying to save himself at the cost of others\\' lives, then soft again, then jerk, and so on. Especially in the last episode, his changes make absolutely no sense whatsoever.Before his last friend dies, she asks him to promise to go look for her brother, but he doesn\\'t promise (in a \"I won\\'t promise, because we are both getting out of here\" kind of moment, although not actually voiced that way.) When he\\'s out, he enters jerk mode, effectively not going after her brother for a whole year.Anyway, his girl friend is killed by his ex-best-friend-forever, so, obviously, the protagonist is forced into jerk mode and tries to kill his ex-friend-turned-arch-enemy... Until he has an opportunity to win the game and let him die... Making him go back into soft mode... Then his ex-best-friend, for absolutely no imaginable reason, kills himself (in a \"if I don\\'t die, we are both going to die, so I better kill myself, because you bozo won\\'t let me die\" moment...) Game over! The protagonist wins, time to go home, in jerk mode, of course, for reasons.Then, another plot twist, shamelessly copied from \"Saw\" (2004): one of the protagonist\\'s previously dead friends was not dead at all, he was the mastermind and game master! After a long and boring speech, which is basically a Korean translation of the final speech from \"Saw III\" (2006), the protagonist enters soft mode again and go after his dead girl friend\\'s brother (something that makes absolutely no sense, as she had never said who or where he was, because she was very secretive about her past, having escaped from North Korea - even her name was kept secret!)BUT (yes, a huge \"but\" there) he was in false soft mode! After getting the boy out of the orphanage he was kept in, he ditches him (and a case full of money) with the old mother of a dead friend and disappears! After that, he enters actual soft mode and gets a ticket to fly to meet his daughter, whom he supposedly loved so much that he decided to risk his life getting back into the Squid Game (to be fair, he also did it to save his mother\\'s life, whom he finds dead after he goes back home, but two wrongs don\\'t make one right, right?)BUT (oh no, another plot twist!), on his way to the airport, he meets the guy that recruited him to play the Squid Game...! And does nothing about it! He continues on his way to the airport, because he loves his daughter, right? Apparently, wrong! As he\\'s boarding the plane, he decides to pick the recruiter\\'s card and call: he wants revenge for what they did to him, and he\\'s mad, and he\\'s back in full throttle jerk mode...! What, again, makes absolutely no sense! The mastermind is dead, so whoever is the game master has absolutely nothing to do with him! Besides, he voluntarily decided to enter the game, so, if any one\\'s to be blamed for all that happened, it\\'s himself!Except for one game (tug-of-war), all others are amazingly lame and people die for nothing, just to advance the plot toward the scripted lame ending.The random changes of heart of the characters made me want to finish watching the series just to get over with it and never look back. Aside from the protagonist\\'s soft/jerk mode switching, what happened to his ex-best-friend-forever was probably the worst character development I have ever seen. In the beginning, we are made to believe he\\'s a nice guy with a truck-load of bad luck. Then, when he\\'s back into the game, he secretly tries to kill all of his friends, for absolutely no reason. To make it very clear that the first time was not a mistake or misunderstanding, he does it again and again and again till the final game.Because of all those completely random and irrational changes, I was simply unable to hate the ex-best-friend or sympathise with the protagonist! All I could see was a stupid writer forcing the characters to push the plot forward, against logic and common sense.And talking about logic and common sense, did I mention that the Squid Game is a secret organisation? Well, it is, kind of obviously. As mentioned before, the \"people\" behind it have an almost supernatural knowledge about everyone and nobody outside have any knowledge about it/them. Even so, the series introduces a subplot twist: there is a secret organisation operating inside the secret organisation, stealing and trafficking organs from the people that die in the games, without anyone in the Squid Game society noticing! Later, it\\'s revealed that the Squid Game society actually knew that there was an organ trafficking group working behind the scenes, what makes even less sense, because how could a secret society infiltrate inside an even more secret society, and why would that society let such a huge liability operate freely inside it?The best character in the whole series is a random police officer that collects the protagonist\\'s report about the Squid Game society when he gets out the first time. Despite not believing in his seemingly absurd story about a secret society playing deadly games, he tried to help him in all ways he could.I\\'ve heard that there will be a second season, but I don\\'t want to watch it, because the protagonist is a schizophrenic jerk, the Squid Game society is made of dumb jerks (making people outside necessarily even dumber, as they can\\'t figure them out) and the writer knows absolutely nothing about character development. Even if the producers would fix all those issues, what I absolutely doubt, the series would still be completely unwatchable, because either the protagonist stays the jerk anti-hero he\\'d been for most of the first season, or he\\'ll be the jerk superhero, that abandoned his daughter for revenge, who he seemed to have become in the last few seconds of the last episode, that is, either way, he\\'ll be a jerk.',\n",
       "   \"Finally finished this series.

       "   \"Didn't expect to see exactly that what the movie is, but that was just the pleasant surprise. I like the idea of the people target to play the game, how they refuse, yet reinvolve - there is a message already in the first two episodes. As for how the show goes - good acting with great selection of casual-looking people, it holds its Asian manners, which is also his charm - brings their specific craziness and cruelty even, yet at some moments it is funny just as they can do it, but it is not a comedy at all. The entire show intends to bring a message, even after the outcome, it is a nice thing after so much gore. And happily, we don't see another unnecessary and intrusive homo love story.The scenes are captive, great colors and screen format, all the details are perfectly touched, the music nicely fits the acts. No wonder Squid Game is so popular, it simply deserves it.\",\n",
       "   \"I really wanted to enjoy this series after all the hype, but just found it lacking in any real substance. There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don't win. That's it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there. I'd recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror.\",\n",
       "   \"It's a watchable series but not something that will make me watch a season 2. The cast is great, acting is good (except for the English speaking VIPs wearing masks). The personal stories of the contestants and how they interact between each other make the series more human than just a survival game. It does get bloody and somewhat violent as most survival game films do. So, one season is good enough for me.\",\n",
       "   'I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.',\n",
       "   \"Outstanding acting performance by ALL actors, so it looks realistic despite of the imaginary plot. People who hit rock bottom and have nothing to lose or that simply have no other choice take the very high risk of death hoping to win a kids game that will solve all their problems for good, or so they think. The only problem is that those who lose the game are killed immediately, so it's actually a game of life and death.

The tv series is great compared to Alice in Borderland. We can understand better where the characters are coming from, and what drives them as individuals. And the idea of deadly children\\'s games is unexpected and refreshing. With each death of the main characters, some do feel sadness and disappointment. However, the tv series is not perfect, with my ability to predict who will win, who will be betrayed, and who is behind it all.

It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one..

       "   'Squid Game is such a successful show that presented one-of-a-kind filmmaking elements that were never seen before. From its unique story to its visually stunning shots, the show deserved everything it got.The show really presented a powerful dramatic topic in the most beautiful way. You constantly be asking yourself who is right and who is wrong?. You get to see the different emotional decisions that characters have to go through to either sacrifice their lives or defend and protect themselves.Really loved how the show manifests the different characters and the diversity between them. It doesn\\'t focus on one character, it rather focuses on around 7 different characters. You get to see the old, the young, the poor, the rich, the female, the male, and even the husband and wife. This makes the story even 10x better as we get to see everything and everyone\\'s decision and how they react to these different games.I feel like the show was better when it was mysterious. As soon as things started to get revealed to us, the show lost itself and that mysteriousness vibe that it was offering. But, at the same time if things kept being mysterious, then the questions would\\'ve never been answered so the show would\\'ve been even worse. The show had plot holes and things that just didn\\'t make sense at all. Like stupid decisions made by characters, or stupid character developments, or cheezy lines like the ones in \"English\" (and not Korean). Like why not keep everything in Korean?! Why do you have to add English dialogues and characters?!. But on the other hand, the show offered us many elements that covered these bad plot holes and made us not think about them as much as we think about the good stuff. For instance, the visually stunning set design with its beautiful colors that are matching perfectly together and with each game that they were playing especially they are meant to be for children so the bright pinky colors explain all of that. The custom designs as well alongside the masks gave that scary, suspense, and thriller atmosphere.The acting is beyond amazing. Each actor presented the dramatic side and life of their character perfectly and their acting plays a huge part in how we were easily connecting with each character. The acting of the VIPs was one of the worst things that I have ever seen.The show\\'s 9 episodes are written very beautifully and carefully. This is why they turned to be great. The 2nd episode with its amazing title, \"Hell\" explains every back story. Although it was a boring episode, without it the show would\\'ve literally been nothing and the characters would\\'ve meant nothing. Really loved how the show presented a specific character that was quiet and didn\\'t have any lines in the whole show except for one specific episode and we were easily connected emotionally to that character. It took the writer only one episode to make us connect deeply with the character that was quiet in previous episodes. That is enough to explain how each thing about this whole TV show was written with deep thinking and creativity.Finally, the beautiful music score is composed by Jung Jaeil, the same composer of Parasite (2019). You can hear the similarities between the two. Especially that both of them discuss such a sensitive and realistic topic which is greed, the difference between the poor and rich, and what people are willing to do for \"money\". The music score played an important role, especially in emotional scenes. They made these scenes way more emotional than they should be and added a lot of meaning to them.My rating is 8.5/10.',\n",

       "   'My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed. He was detestable. First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i\\'d feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate \\'hunger games\\'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It\\'s just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head \"what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?\". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.Ending, without any spoilers... Here\\'s the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn\\'t end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it\\'s a 9-episode long show, the \"sad ending\" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix? If so... eh, sure.I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6.. but without knowing the characters and their relationship... Eh it\\'s either all or none case, sadly.

       "   \"Hwang Dong-hyuk's thrilling, hyper-violent, unique Korean TV series steaming now on Netflix is one of the most original and gripping shows ever produced for the medium. Taking place in South Korea, it concerns people who are in serious financial ruin that receive a mysterious invitation to compete in a series of children's game at a secret location that could earn the sole winner the ultimate prize of millions of dollars in cash, but the catch is you have a certain amount of time to succeed, and the losers are brutally executed on the spot. The series' lead protagonists are Seong, sensationally played by Lee Jung-Jae, a divorce gambling addict with a lovely young daughter who is in deep debt to some vicious loan sharks, his childhood friend Cho Sang-woo, superbly played by Park Hae-soo, who was the golden boy of the neighborhood that went to a prestigious business university, and now his wanted by the police for embezzling great sums of money from clients of the company he worked for, a beautiful young pickpocket named Kang Sae-byeok, impressively played by Jung Hoyeon, who needs the money for her baby brother who is in an orphanage, a Pakistani migrant worker, Ali Adul, terrifically played by Anupam Tripathi, who is on the run and is desperate for money to support his infant child and beloved wife, a sickly old man, Oh ll-nam, endearingly played by Oh Yeong-su, who has nothing to lose, and a murderous criminal, Jang Deok-su, memorably played by Heo Sung-tae, who is on the run from killer gangsters. Marvelously directed by Dong-hyuk, it has a truly engrossing screenplay by Hwang Dong-hyuk, stunning cinematography by Lee hyeong-Deok, and incredibles sets. This highly addictive show had me and my dear wife on the edge of our seats, the suspense is almost unbearable at times. We cannot want for season two to get here. Highly recommended.\",\n",

But I'd like to point out two things.First one is complaints about predictability. I strongly disagree that view. Until the last second of the game, you'll be wondering who is going to be the winner. Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show.Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors. It's true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time. Therefore it doesn't affect the overall experience in my opinion. If you're a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won't be a problem at all. Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you'll find their performance laughable anyways. Actors here reminds me IP Man 2. Regardless this is not a serious issue to lean on.In short, don't miss it out and believe the hype. Definitely deserves to watch.\",\n",

I like the simplicity of it: people want money, they compete in deadly games to get it. There are opportunities to leave, but the need for all that money is greater than risking their life. The bases are pretty well covered. Visually it's like a demented Dr Seuss story. Loved the sets!The bad (or, the picky): the VIP's are stupid with horrible acting, everything the rest of the show isn't. The surprise ending is cool, but the explanation is pretty lacking for a show with tons of detail. I guess they can use season 2 for this. As a stand-alone you have to just accept that someone has the money and imagination to put together such an elaborate and secretive series of games for the benefit of a few bored rich people. And the workers? No explanation how the control is there at all.\",\n",

Out of 456 contestants, all down with debts are ready to sacrifice their lives to earn money, sounds a familiar subject but the Netflix team has converted it to unnerving deadly battle.Premise is simple and the characters are introduced quite fast but smoothly.

Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end.

I always expected it to be a sort of highly intelligent game show kind of film but when I finally sat watching the first episode, I definitely know it is going to be another parasite.Again, I don't hate parasite, in the same way, I don't hate this series. Squid game had a good pace with it, not once I felt bored and I really admired the effort that these film makers have put in to the show but, BUT, the series, same as the film, was insanely dark, disturbing and hopeless.I mean, why do you have to create such series and pour in more negativity into this world? Don't you have enough? I think this is the problem with not only this but most of the Korean films/dramas, called to be 'thrillers' these days and the fact that these inhumane shows get widespread acclaim is horrifying and making me question the future of this world.Judgements aside, the series also had major flaws like crappy characters, predictable tale telling and confusing logic. At times, you cannot find motives for a character's action at all. Some characters had no back story, no arc, no depth, even though they were prioritized over other disposable characters.I mean, do these people ever think what will happen if they get killed? With what hope, they are entering the game show? What are the odds' of having multiple winners? Did they really choose to return even after watching a bloody massacre in front of their eyes? Did they really think that these people can be trusted after watching that?Coming to the male lead, Who leaves their sick mom for days/months to play a dangerous game in the hopes of winning money and returns hoping that she would be alive? What are the chances of winning the game (1 out of 456)? Did they really think they will have multiple winners? Which game has that?Do any of these characters live for themselves? If the characters are so sentimental towards their loved ones, why risk their own lives in the first place? Would the loved ones think that the money is better than the loss of their children/parents?Why did the female lead leave her only brother to play the game when she had no debts? She could have lead a good life here in South Korea making peace with her mind that she cannot see her mom again. Did she really think that her mom would be happy after coming to SK and to know that her only daughter is dead? What were the odds that after the escape, her mom would still be left alive in NK? Did she put her entire life in danger, trusting on some blind instincts?Now that I think of this series, there were so many things that didn't make sense or plainly were there to psychologically torture the characters. The series, as parasite did, left my heart with a hollow and I'm stressed out. Like life is not stressful enough.I'm alarmed at the ratings that this weak show has been given and seriously feel frightened of this sadist community, who I know will not dare to kill anyone if the dystopian future arrives. I'll rather take my own life than to play a people killing game like this.\",\n",
       "   \"I hate Netflix with all my soul, but was surprised by the superb concepts and style of Squid Game, with human, complex characters, and plot. I can honestly say I found the show brilliant at times, with honest, raw emotion present, intertwined with unflinching violence, and more than capable actors turning in poignant and nuanced performances. I loved it. Until the very last episode. The pacing was off, multiple twists that just didn't seem to fit, and just a tone and feel that felt way off after 8 episodes. I would have given this a 9 or maybe even a 10 if the final episode had been..more fitting. I still give it a solid 8/10. Great show.\",\n",

So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it.\",\n",

I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion.

And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.\",\n",

       "   'Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It\\'s basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It\\'s basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much \"micromanagement\" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it\\'s really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the \"micromanagement\" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.',\n",

One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator.

Sexual, verbal ,physical, just plain, coarse ,cruel and bloody-minded violence. Absolutely not reccomended to everyone under the age of 18.Regarding the plot , there was some parts with no reason. For example the whole story about the policeman was just unnecessary as he was not involved with the main characters.In my opinion only the last episode tried to \"save\" the whole disturbing face of the drama showing a more human side , and giving the moral message that money don\\'t bring happiness.',\n",

The same general idea isn\\'t a unique one (eg. It\\'s similar to Brazil\\'s \"3%\"), but the my build in enough sub-plots, mystery, and kind of cliffhanger endings, for it to have a fair bit of intrigue.The setting also works. Real life scenes in the city are mostly either dark or grey, contrasting with the childlike bright colours and symbols of the games. It\\'s definitely quirky and somewhat atmospheric.Cons\\nBut that\\'s all let down by some weak acting, annoying voice actor in the English dubbed version, and characters either who are too stereotypical or whose personalities change in a whim.There\\'s some decent acting and character development as well, but it\\'s way overdone (exaggerated facial expressions and \\'tantrums\\') by the main character and a several of the stereotypical ones are where the acting is really overdone.By the end, when they start revealing the motivations behind it all;m, it gets pretty weak, stereotypical (again), and exaggerated.In addition to this, there\\'s so much potential for a political or sociocultural commentary. So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them. (The latter is what \"3%\" does really well). But the dialogue doesn\\'t really touch on the issues at all. More focus on blood and guts than on any potential insight.Overall, too many characters make no sense, and it ultimately feels hollow in the end.',\n",
       "   \"Absolutely amazing show. The plot is not predictable which I find very intriguing. Kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. Not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. With all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one I've seen to date. There are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all I highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you.

       "   \"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!\",\n",
       "   \"This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun.\",\n",
       "   \"I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn't even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising. Also has some mind blowing twists in it. Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one. I couldn't believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting.This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn't yet. I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it. He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors.Do not miss out on this series!\",\n",

Mix that in with a massively predictable and immature plot (the old man was obviously behind it all) and a \"Luke I am your brother\" Star Wars re-hash crossover (complete with Darth Vader type villain) and mix that with a bit of The Hunger Games and you get this.The moral side of it is warped too and the main characters - nay, all of the characters remain very unlikeable, annoying and unrelatable.

But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they\\'re unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.Usually when the acting is good, we don\\'t notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor\\'s blank face with the character\\'s emotions \"betrayed\" by only the twitching of one eye.Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story.

All other game shows that you can win money and prizes, don't drug you and have masked people. The first game was so stupid. Every single person moved at red light. Ever so slightly, but they still moved. And only some got shot? And all those people still ran after they saw guys get shot when they moved? Are they all idiots? And green light and red light switched on time, but when all those people got shot, it stayed red for awhile. Why? Really stupid. Also you know you can die so why continue playing.

However, there is a catch: \"Losers must pay with their lives!\"My Thoughts:\\nIt\\'s been about two days since I finished Squid Game, and it hasn\\'t left my mind. I still can\\'t believe I finished all nine episodes in one sitting.The acting is beyond phenomenal, and it elicited emotions in me that I had never felt before in any other show. EVERYTHING about the production value, the plot, the character development, the set designs, was simply amazing. I went into this show expecting to mostly enjoy it and then move on, but I had no idea it would have such an impact on me.Squid Game amazingly combines the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the harsh realities of adulthood by forcing ordinary people to compete in life or deathmatches to potentially wipe out their debts. It\\'s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer that\\'s equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing. In other words, there is something for everyone in this show. It\\'s emotional, dramatic, with enough blood scenes to satisfy suspense and thrill-seekers.In a nutshell, according to me, the current buzz surrounding Squid Game is well-deserved. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who hasn\\'t seen it. This is one of my favorites on Netflix right now.',\n",
       "   \"This Korean drama shows up Hollywood in every way. By the third episode, the viewer is totally immersed in the characters' struggles, because this is just good writing. Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren't as good as the first ones, but I suspect they're planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad.\",\n",
       "   \"The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.\",\n",
       "   \"I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don't have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and 'Jesus?' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved.\",\n",

Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it's not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8. Probably because I have seen Money Heist, Exam, Cube, Saw etc hence I didn't find the plot as completely new and offbeat.\"],\n",

       " 'Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun': [['When I heard of this Korean high school zombie series I was interested, despite the subject matter being done to death over the years. Then I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing. Having just finished up the show, I can confirm that this is one of the most entertaining shows out there, and far surpasses the likes of THE WALKING DEAD. The small scale works a treat and somehow they manage to eke out the momentum over the whole 12-episode arc. It never feels too small and it never feels dull, packed as it is with expertly directed action and tense mayhem. The Koreans excel in this one and I loved every minute of it.',\n",
       "   \"I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.\",\n",
       "   \"So I decided to give the live action a go because I saw it's No 4 in Ireland on Netflix right now and I found out that it is based off a Webtoon. Yeah it's not a great art so definitely this was the better version personally! I may not be a fan of zombie themed stuff because they are always obvious and you know wtf was going to happen. I mean, this series isn't any different from every zombie flick out there but at least it puts some twists and turns to make you interested. I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads. Even if the ending was pretty much a very questionable one, the characters, the music and the storyline in a way were entertaining enough. Yes it is clique in some parts with,using recycled horror tropes but again, I really enjoyed it and glad I didn't bother with the Webtoon...\",\n",
       "   \"The show started gripping, quite interesting and super awesome in more than one instances with a stellar second episode (the best out of the lot in my opinion), but quickly got mixed in drama, melodrama and selfless / guilt-ridden sacrificial behavior and ended in a semi-dramatic and mutationally mysterious way.Infection, brutality, devilish evilness and gore gave way to cute friendship, proposals, long talks, chitchats, dramatic and melodramatic behavior with some sacrificial intensity here and there and in-between.I'm not against a second season and in fact i would love to see one coming to reality; it's just that the sort of drastic turn of events as depicted happily and mysteriously were sort of weakening and a more brutal, shocking variant and finale would have been more of service to the soul of the show.\",\n",
       "   'The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series. From the ridiculous lines, to the moronic \"decisions\" to the horrible way they treated some characters. The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show.',\n",
       "   'All of Us Are Dead: Zombie outbreak at a high school in Hyosan. South Korea. Most of characters are meant to be 16-17 but this is really an adult drama, when the students turn Zombie they bite out throats, take chunks out of people. Victims and Zombies alike jump and fall out of windows, frantic boys and girls barricade themselves in classrooms, battle against the Zombies. Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok. A horror series which shocks but the terror is leavened by the teen love stories. The outbreak spreads. Zombie hordes charging at lines of riot police, even 3 deep they struggle to hold them back. Zombies munching on intestines. The dranas between the still human students becoming more intense. Refugees fleeing Hyosan are \"othered\", feared, even attacked. As so ften happens the authorities abandon the inhabitants of Hyosan while pretending to help them. It\\'s an old trope but is given new life (or death) here due to the editing, acting and direction. How the Zombie virus was created is gradually revealed, it\\'s root cause tied in with events which transpired at the school, you\\'ll have to watch the series to put everything together, no spoilers here! Really convincing acting and effects. Directed by Lee Jae-kyoo and Kim Nam-su. Written by Chun Sung-il. 12 episodes on Netflix. 9/10.',\n",
       "   'Zombie series with a very classic atmosphere and a very banal but still valid plot. In general the series is entertaining and at times has some very interesting twists and manages well to keep the tension. Many points are tragic and pay off. Too bad that after a while the series becomes a bit too monotonous because the protagonists run away and get stuck in a different point every time until the next episode and this thing in the long run a little tired.',\n",
       "   'Review By Kamal KSeason 1 - 6/10\"All of us are dead\" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn\\'t fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama\\'s story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.Postive -EntertainmentEmotionsNegative -Plot HolesIllogical Things.',\n",
       "   \"This is one off the charts crazy ride through hell. Wow!!If you enjoyed Train to Busan, you will love this. Insanely intense action and amazing character development and sub plots. Honestly, I could not stop binge watching.I can't praise this series enough. What an incredible ride!!!Well done, Netflix!\",\n",
       "   \"On-jo: Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead.Probably the most infuriating show of this year so far. When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there's 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let's rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo's dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it's supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don't they learn? It's an urgent situation, but they can't be that stupid.Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10.\",\n",
       "   'I really liked this show and left reviews on a couple of episodes...but here Im going to talk about major plot holes that for some reason are not being discussed over the internet.So the high school science teacher must have actually created a cure that is neither shown nor does he talk about it. The problem is the cure was only temporary. He cured his son and his son went back to school. But he died or became angry and turned into a halfbie or something else. He could still talk, after fully transforming. But he never talked in any of the videos.Zombies are attracted to thunder and cannot see is thwarted by the flaresThe military does not save the kids saying they could be infected and not know it...By that logic so could everyone back at camp. Making the decision not to save the children completely flawed.Also maybe its a Korean or Asian thing, but why does the military commander kill himself after blowing up the zombies.And lastly i think...The half zombie girl jumps off the roof of the school...We were just shown that they still get hurt even if they can slowly recover...so she just broke both her legs on that landing.All the zombies are dead now so will season 2 be a vampire show?',\n",
       "   'Having seen shows and movies like \"Goblin,\" \"Squid Game,\" \"Miracle in Cell Number 7,\" \"Train to Busan,\" \"The Flu,\" \"Love in the Moonlight,\" \"Kingdom\" and the Philippine made \"Block Z,\" I can definitely say that \"All of Us Are Dead\" is one of the most okay yet overhyped Korean series and Zombie flick on social media. Featuring storylines and premises done better in the movies and shows I have mentioned - like drama, romance and Zombies in a campus - the series is predictable and only adds one thing new: the \"Halfbies.\"',\n",
       "   'I don\\'t know if extreme bullying, to death, is what Netflix should be pushing on kids right now.I mean, who doesn\\'t like a bunch of pointless hyper-violence, but that\\'s all this otherwise cringey generic zombie movie has going for it. It\\'s annoying, the characters are annoying, the lack of context is annoying... the random attempts at slapstick comedy out of nowhere are ridiculous...Insufferable female characters, super goofy doormat beta male characters... so you know Netflix made this, except unlike white shows, they don\\'t seem to force any \"diversity\" on their Korean and Japanese productions, eh? Everyone\\'s a black-haired Korean with a bowl cut. Now that\\'s not an issue, but if everyone\\'s a blond-haired white person suddenly Netlfix goes out of its way to replace most of \\'em with (( black female and/or another woke-approved default race and gender )).Also I\\'m not happy that Lee Yoo-mi, who played one of the sweetest characters in Squid Game is now playing the pointlessly worst character ever. She\\'s been turned into one of those insufferable female characters that the males are too simpy to throw off a roof. In fact all the female characters get to kick, punch and yell at the males, while they just take it like absolute betas. And if you\\'re okay with this as a male - you\\'re pretty much the same doormat. Welp anyways... PSA over.Watch #Alive instead, it\\'s a much better zombie movie, and yes, it\\'s a movie, meaning it\\'ll take less of your time than binge-watching this trash.I gotta admit though, the cinematography and choreography are amazing, and so is the acting -- at least in the first few episodes. Most of the action-packed shots look like they\\'ve been done in one take, which is incredible. If only the writing was actually good, and the whole \"zombie bites someone and they get a veiny rash, then they\\'re a zombie\" concept wasn\\'t so grossly overdone. And all of this praise, again, is just for the first few episodes, because everything quickly goes downhill in terms of production quality and general effort after episode 3.',\n",
       "   \"Korean Industry has set high expectations about Zombie movies and dramas. So,if I compare this with these than this is nothing infront of those masterpieces. It is an avarage Zombie drama about how the school students survives from Zombie Apocalypse. I find the reflection of ''High School of dead '' anime somehow. It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren't much character development and plenty of plot holes. Most funny thing is some zombies don't even die after killing multiple times. What they are trying to convey? They are immortal??The ending is awful. I don't think there is any season needed, it was already dragged too much but they ended it this way.\",\n",
       "   \"The show started in a brilliant way and I thought this would be some unique in the zombie genre. As things were shown in a very realistic way. But, the way the episodes moved forward I started to lose interest. As I felt some middle episodes were so repetitive & lengthy. The show didn't deserve 12 hrs runtime. After finishing the season I can say the story would've been completed within 8 - 9 hrs max. One thing I can't deny is that this show was technically brilliant.Each character had its own story, it's not a problem for a series. But, in a Zombie apocalypse it has been shown in a very stretchy way. In the other hand, some characters didn't end up the way they should've been. As an audience we get to know so many things but the character didn't, that's the reason it was very disturbing to watch some scenes. Last 4 episodes were too much interesting and were the best episodes of the show. Good thing is that we get to know some good survival techniques.Finally, it's not the best in zombie genre but of course A Very Good Watch.Available on Netflix.© Zombieddict.\",\n",
       "   \"Meski sesekali melepaskan pijakan dari ruang lingkup sekolah demi menyentil aspek sosial-politik, series Korea ini tak pernah berhenti 'menggigit' lewat segala momen ketegangan dan emosi kehilangan di antara siswa-siswi dengan ragam karakteristik yang amat relevan.Kita sebagai penonton seakan ada di tengah mereka untuk turut merasakan takut, sedih, bingung, putus asa sambil menjaga asa bertahan hidup. Perlahan tapi pasti fokus dan keberpihakan diarahkan pada tokoh Lomon, Ji-hu, Chan-young, Yi-hyun lewat konflik percintaan/perundungan ala remaja.Lee JQ & Kim Nam-soo piawai memanfaatkan sisi geografis SMU Hyosan sebagai panggung teror berlapis sehingga tidak terkesan repetitif. Pergerakan kamera dinamis serta tata rias/kostum dan efek khusus yang terbilang di atas rata-rata berhasil menjaga ritme show secara keseluruhan.Zombie outbreak yang terjadi memang menyisakan banyak pertanyaan dengan simplifikasi logika yang cenderung masih dapat diterima nalar. Pola infeksi tunggal yang menyebar cepat bagai efek domino sukses membuat kita binge-watching atau mungkin repeat-viewing sambil menanti season 2 nya.(Hopefully soon and better, finger crossed).\",\n",
       "   'All of Us Are Dead is South Korea\\'s latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who\\'ve managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there\\'s nothing new.All of Us Are Dead\\'s zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it\\'s giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky \"oners,\" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that\\'s enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.My Rating : 7.5/10.',\n",
       "   'A Korean high school is the epicentre for a virus which turns the students into flesh eating zombies. The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack. It has plenty of individual introspection as friends and family fall victim and although not the best storyline each episode does enough to hold your interest for the whole series to discover the outcome.',\n",
       "   \"I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people's actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight. The rest of us is a no.\",\n",
       "   \"Although this is a Teenage horror. It is probably rated 19+ for the gore. The horror, as in other Kdramas ike Squid Game, Hellbound, is something other than the obvious. It is also about the people around you and bullying - even when you turned into a zombie.That's the clever part. But there are inconsistencies (like unnecessary sacrifices, stupid moves, and turning up the sentiments - parents dying ), some continuity issues in the beginning and maybe suffers a bit from a large cast. The chaos breaks out at end of episode 1 before all the characters were introduced just to grab your attention. And that is a bit hasty. We want entertainment, but we are not starved.At first there were multiple groups, including the cop that was interviewing the science teacher, the first aid x military dad, the arrow group and the main group in the music studio. This is needed to connect and elaborate the story but you know who is the main character group is. It would be too perfect for bullied girl to get even with the annoying bullying guy. There are some good plot points with mutation, rain/ thunder and toilet making.There are also well done set pieces like the intentional infection, rooftop scenarios and the dispair turning into some hope last episode. Technically well done but some holes like martial law can order such a strike without Parliament/heads of state approval? The assembly person seems to be a setup for next season? The rain gave them water, but no food for like 4-5days???\",\n",
       "   'This is what good television is but you should absolutely NOT compare it to other zombie series\\'. Anyway! Korean zombies are far more terrifying in their look than western TV and film zombies!The Zombies are just as terrifying as the ones in the other South Korean Zombie series\\'; like the excellent \"KINGDOM\" or the brilliant South Korean film \"RAMPAGE\"! I love it and its good fun watchable television; better than any reality series trash!The only time that the series is/was calm and plodding along was in the first episode - before anyone turned Zombie - but after that it was a case of Shock, jump out of skin and a continuous Holy Crap viewing time :) Its come along just in time seeing that \"The WALKING DEAD\" will be no more each week...it had a good run though and was highly enjoyable viewing.Don\\'t sit next to your girlfriend, sister or wife when watching this; unless you are wearing some kind of, good thick anti nails digging into your arm, protection!

Its not like The Walking Dead where they dont call them zombie because in their world, zombie never exist, not even in movie. But, in this korean series, they call them \"zombie\" from the beginning. Sacrifice and responsibility plays a big role in this series, when people live in desperation, they never left their side of humanity. That\\'s what make this series fun. Its a fun zombie movie with a lot of action and cliche from all zombie movie in history. Have fun.',\n",
       "   \"There's a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it's all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you'll feel it.However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You've seen them all before, many times.Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There's far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.It's not amazing, but it's solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time.\",\n",
       "   \"George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn't saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero's US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England's island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don't care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.But they are teenagers, and they try.Romero would like this series.\",\n",
       "   '\"All of us are dead\" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn\\'t fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama\\'s story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.',\n",

But I only made it a few episodes in before tuning out.\",\n",

I also like the fact that they threw some drama in it and made the characters have personality so that you'll at least care for some of them.Anyway I can't wait for season 2.

The action is well filmed, the acting adequate and the pacing for the first seven episodes tight and disciplined.Of course, the show is not without major faults, the biggest being characters just standing there as zombies attack, reacting only at the last second. I laughed every time because it plays into the MacGruber joke and does it too many times.Too bad ep 8 is so boring, The series tries to get back on track but loses its way with too much repetition (a sense of deju vu abounds throughout as the series progresses).',\n",
       "   'Breaking from tradition, \"All Of Us Are Dead\" Season 1 on Netflix did not hold on to its core suspense until later. In fact, they dragged me into the thick of things right from episode 1. This Korean Horror series had what it took to become yet another jewel in the gilded crown of productions hailing out of South Korea.Directors J. Q. Lee and Kim Nam-Soo did great work distributing their talents across twelve outstanding episodes. Seong-il Cheon\\'s screenplay was neat and did not fuss or bother with unnecessary drama. Hillary Huong Vu\\'s VFX was remarkable. Together, their work cut to the chase and conveyed the show\\'s chilling plot in a pace that can best be described as enviable.The story tracked a zombie virus outbreak that occurred in such a realistic, sinister, and unpredictable manner that I found myself smack in the middle of bloody chaos, just like the main characters were in \"All Of Us Are Dead\".Lee Na Yeon (played by Lee Yoo-mi) was exceptional. Lee Su Hyuk (played by Park Solomon) was captivating. Choi Nam Ra (played by Yi-Hyun Cho) was great. Lee Byeong Chan (played by Byeong-cheol Kim) was engaging. Nam So Ju (played by Jeon Bae-soo) was superb. Song Jae Ik (played by Kyoo-hyung Lee) was amazing. Lee Chung San (played by Chan-Young Yoon) was interesting. Park Mijin (played by Lee Eun-saem) was great.Nam Ohn Jo (played by Ji-hu Park) was good. On-jo (played by Victoria Grace) was compelling. Chang Hoon (played by Shin Jae Hwi) was good. Kim Ji-min (played by Kim Jin Young) was noteworthy. Son Myung-hwan (played by Oh Hee-joon) was superb. Han Gyeong-su (played by Ham Sung-min) was exceptional. Jang Ha-Ri (played by Ha Seung-Ri) was captivating. Jang Woo-jin (played by Son Sang-yeon) was good. Park Young-hwan (played by Dong Hyun-bae) was outstanding.All other cast and crew brought excellence to their roles and positions in the Netflix production \"All Of Us Are Dead\" Season 1. I wish IMDB gathered more crew credits for the show\\'s page - sound effects, musical scoring, set decoration, art direction, hair-makeup, and costume design all did amazing work for this series.The tale took place at a high school, which literally became ground-zero for a zombie outbreak. As with most undead fare, one bite from the infected had the potential to infect a normal person and turn them into a monster as well.The unsuspecting students were soon scrambling for ways to escape the nightmare as more and more of them succumbed to the disease after being attacked. Chances for the remaining survivors to make it out in one piece grew slimmer by the second.It all began when Lee Byeong Chan tested something on a lab hamster. The rodent bit Kim Ji-min (a student) and passed the strange aggressive zombie virus to her. It was all \\'hell broke loose\\' from there on, with the disease spreading into the city as well.Added suspicion lay with Lee Byeong, whose son had mysteriously disappeared a while before the day Kim Ji-min fell \\'ill\\'. He blamed the school for his son being bullied, which allegedly led to the boy\\'s suicide.What was the science teacher up to? What sorts of bizarre experiments was he attempting, and why? His reasons were revealed in the second episode, and they were quite convincing. Also, Lee Byeong\\'s talk of the \\'survivalist mentality\\' of a virus was intriguing.I was surprised when Kim exposed Lee to another teacher, and the rest of her class, in episode one itself. She apparently found a way to escape her plastic-ties, which Lee Byeong Chan had used to hold her captive in his lab. The policeman who was later involved in Kim\\'s kidnapping case had ties to Lee (involving the Science teacher\\'s missing son).\"All Of Us Are Dead\" was \\'zombie survivalist\\' gold. The show was interspersed with human elements and high school romance, and balanced with zombie-horror flourishes. They left mini-cliffhangers at the end of each episode, which was more than admirable. Watch the show in the original Korean language (use subtitles). Such soulful and compelling performances all round.\"All Of Us Are Dead\" Season 1 on Netflix was a thoroughly entertaining deep-dive into zombie outbreak storytelling. There was a surprisingly strong emotional element to the series, especially in the finale. It only proved how masterful Korean filmmakers are at weaving a balanced story, no matter the genre\\'s expected theme.',\n",

Students attacking each other's but the principle is instructing the teachers to call them in class room, a girl is so dumb that she is trying to save her friend who is turned into zombie, a guy is so irritating instead of holding the door he leaves it open to argue with his classmate, the principle is hiding under the table and eating biscuits whole zombies are attacking in front of him etc etc.It's irritating annoying, feel like to throw the maker in front of zombies if given a chance.\",\n",

And now the review of the rest, I watched sync in English (netflix), the sync is extremely poorly done, so it's one iritating disaster of the sync. This series promotes violence and abuse (doh so of course zombies are involved, but not that, it actually promotes peer bullying and abuse). The scenes are sometimes too stretched it's really monotonous. It's too bloody and bizarre for some more serious impression. This is just another failed zombie screenplay, this series is a nightmare, no future there! Not recommend!\",\n",

So, when someone comes up with a new show, it's intriguing because I'm curious to see what's different about this one. This show is your typical Zombie but story set in a high school. It's got something for everyone.The zombie parts of the show were done REALLY WELL. Acting, action choreography, sound design, cinematography - everything was top-notch. Then there's your typical high school story that was a hit/miss. There's commentary on the society & family values - this added depth to the plot.Overall - it's a decent show with a lot of thrills but with minor pacing issues here and there, think Marvel trying to insert random jokes just because they can. They work, but seem out of place. The show has 12 eps, so this is a decent commitment. Could have been 8 eps, maybe 9.If you go down this road, you'll leave satisfied/non-disappointed by the end. If you'll be mind blown or not, is up to your taste.\",\n",
       "   'This follows the well-known and highly successful Korean zombie movie formula that viewers have come to love. We mention here movies like Train to Busan, Peninsula, Kingdom and #Alive. Except for Kingdom, which is a series, all of these are feature films. In the case of Kingdom, the series succeeded in sustaining viewer interest all throughout.All of Us are Dead starts in an exciting way with its fast-paced and taut script. But by the time you reach episode 5, the viewer loses interest. While the lull moments are opportune time for drama, dramatic scenes gradually become a distraction. The surprise ending of that episode involving Gwi-nam tries to put back the story on track, but it appears belated.The young actors (Ji-hi Park, Yi-Hyun Cho, Park Solomon, Chang-young Yoon and In-soo Yoo) are competent. But a meandering story is the problem. At 12 episodes, the series is a bit too long.',\n",

Some really great acting in this one, I even found myself getting annoyed by some of the characters. Amazing CGI and special effects, definitely feels like it had a big budget. There were some plot holes of course, and some things were just left unexplained until the end but it doesn't really affect the viewing experience.\",\n",
       "   'The Good: I could go on and on about everything I love about All of Us Are Dead, but if I had to point out a few \"killer apps\" that makes this show special, it would be:1) The Characters: I find this show fascinating for its characters. Most of them are well worn Korean TV tropes (the dashing hero, the quiet good girl, the selfish jerk) and none particularly stand out. What is fleshed out and what I observe to be a major cultural difference between Korean and American content, are the RELATIONSHIPS. Ultimately, what makes these characters great is how willing and capable they are in putting themselves on the line to save the group. The interpersonal dynamics, not unique or fleshed out personal characteristics, is what makes them super interesting to watch.2) The Writing: This show REALLY surprised me with the incredibly nuanced take it had on government and the military. The teens, immersed in hell with no one to come and save them, become naturally cynical of the \"adults\" who promise to protect them. The show could have played on the (frankly, lazy) idea of a ruthless, evil government turning its back on vulnerable people. Yet, we get to see the \"state\" perspective on these events as well, and the show forces us to consider the typical Hollywood version of events.If you were on the other side of the quarantine zone, would you not want your government and military to do ANYTHING possible from stopping the spread of a zombie virus? If your answer is no, you\\'re lying.Even the leaders - political and military - depicted are given sympathy and we come to see that they\\'re not purely motivated by personal desire, but a real sense of duty. When the Councillor gives a genuinely intelligent explanation as to why abandoning your post to save your family - as an emergency worker - is the wrong thing to do...my jaw hit the floor. I love a show that acknowledges that the world isn\\'t black and white. It\\'s refreshing.3) The Zombies & Action: Zombies are kind of overplayed. We get them, we\\'ve seen them. Half of the population thinks they could \"easily\" survive a zombie apocalypse. Yet, the zombies in All of Us Are Dead bring the horror back. These contorting, inhumane, unstoppable killing machines are legitimately terrifying and lead to some of the most intense and kinetic zombie action scenes I\\'ve seen in a long time. I think it\\'s safe to say at this point that Korean zombies are objectively the most terrifying. It\\'s with these scenes that the creators had the most fun with the camerawork and editing.Oh, and lest I forget, there\\'s some AMAZING martial artistry at play in this show. Environmental action on par with some of the best kung fu...god I love this freakin\\' thing.4) The Narrative: There\\'s a lot of fun to be had with this plot; we have multiple intersecting characters, half zombies, a Terminator style villain, government intrigue, a mad scientist. It\\'s just a barrel of fun that keeps things going. Yet, this show is completely uncompromising as well; it is sad, depressing, and totally willing to off any character. The tension generated is insane and frankly exhausting at times.But, the ending - which again bucks the tropes - is surprisingly heartfelt and ultimately quite hopeful. It\\'s almost reaffirming in how much faith it has in humanity and wonderful after 12 - often very intense - episodes.The Bad: I have basically two gripes with the show. One, it could\\'ve been cut down a bit and towards the end gets a bit repetitive. But, honestly, I came to love the story and characters so much that I didn\\'t mind. However, I would suggest breaking the show up in chunks and not powering through it.The other issue the inconsistency with the virus itself. I guess some people are naturally immune, but it\\'s a little confusing and sometimes comes off as a plot convenience.The Ugly: This show is super interesting for those (like myself) who love observing cultural differences (which is perhaps my biggest argument for steadily consuming foreign film and TV). Unlike Parasite, something that clearly came from a person who is a fan of Hollywood (and as such, it kind of feels less Korean, more international), All of Us Are Dead feels more grounded in South Korean culture.As such, there were countless moments when I thought to myself...\"an American show or character would do X,\" in contrast to these characters. There\\'s a much greater emphasis on duty (as a parent, as a first responder, as a teacher), saving face, hierarchy (upper classmen are to be respected regardless of whether they \"deserve it\"), group interests over individual interests (all the villains are people who put their own goals ahead of the group) and so on. I found this aspect of the show to really put it over the top for me, as it felt very refreshing and different.',\n",

Why did the girl in pink just die and become a full zombie if she was bitten by the bully kid and same for the kid on white with the bowl cut and naamra whose a super zombie? They did all this running around but there was food and sodas in the closet and nobody touched on that just the candy bar and doing abunch of work to escape a room where they had food and water or sodas. Where was the brains to find a way into the room. Is Chaesun the one who liked Onjo actually dead?

In any case, it gets on my nerves so much that I can hardly endure a film or series from Korea for more than 30 minutes. On top of that, the quality of the content often leaves so much to be desired that out of desperation one begins to read something into it that is not there (Squid Game, Parasite). Hopefully the hype will soon come to an end. And this series here is nothing more than an appeal to the baser instincts of an undemanding young, predominantly probably male audience that feasts on disgusting scenes and is on its way to becoming a generation of jaded psychopaths.\",\n",

       "   'I\\'m a sucker for these zombie movies and shows. They always manage to pull me into watching it. Korea somehow manages to make zombies more interesting compared to western movies and shows. For example, Train to Busan was absolutely stellar. My hope was that this show was on the level of that movie. The premise is \"Set in the South Korean city of Hyosan, things go berserk one day when a girl in the Hyosan High School is bitten by a rat infected by a deadly virus that turns happy humans into devastatingly ugly and ever-hungry human eating machines\". So does Korea deliver another excellent zombie action or is it a big miss?Let\\'s get the obvious out of the way first, the zombie action is indeed exciting to watch. There are some exciting and creative sequences in this show such as the dining hall sequence which is filmed like one shot. There are some other creative sequences such as one involving a fight between two individuals on top of bookcases while zombies are underneath. Another is where the characters build a giant wall to hold off zombies while they escape the other way. Another is where they create a circular wall while getting from point A to B. All these sequences feel very original and I certainly enjoyed watching them. I also have to give a lot of praise to the makeup artist as the zombies look frighteningly good. The zombie actors also do a good job as well in making them feel inhuman and unnatural. The zombies here are definitely quite scary and that is quite a feat considering how oversaturated zombies are in media.The actors all do a phenomenal job in their portrayal. They all manage to give their characters distinct personalities even if they are just minor characters. The actors who die and become zombies also do a great job as zombies. The story is also quite engaging despite just being mostly about surviving. The story focuses on the dynamic and relationship of the surviving school students. We see them work together but also argue and fight but it never feels over the top or anything. What the story does the best is in delivering on the emotions and there is definitely some emotional stuff. We also got a more interesting origin for the virus that is also quite sympathetic and we got some special zombies that give the situation more spice to it. They also spend a fair amount of time with the military in the series to give the audience an understanding of their response to the virus. There is also quite a bit of romance in this and it surprisingly works well despite the situation not being the exact best for this.However, there is a lot of characters in this show and honestly maybe too many. The show doesn\\'t just focus on one group of survivors and instead multiple groups which lead to a lot of characters to pay attention to. What can be annoying is that a fair amount of these characters have nothing interesting to them but the series still spends a fair amount of time on them. If a character doesn\\'t have an interesting backstory or personality then they are probably going to die which results in predictable deaths. There are also some characters that are just in the series for no reason such as a streamer that I felt added nothing to the plot apart from taking screen time away from actual interesting characters. Additionally, there are so many moments in this series where a character makes a really stupid decision that is frustrating to watch. Also, the characters not going for the head is a big annoyance. It also gets annoying when some characters stand around instead of helping their friend who is being attacked.The series is also a bit too long and can feel a bit exhausting to watch. It is 12 episodes but after watching, it definitely felt like the series could at least be cut down by 2 episodes. There is a lot of sequences where it does just feel like they are padding for time. For example, we will have scenes where we watch characters stand around or just building and not talking or a scene where they share chocolate and it all feels too long and pointless. There is a \"villain\" in the show and that person is WAY too overused and gets defeated in the same way like 4 times, to the point that it is kind of laughable. There are also some potentially interesting plot lines that they could\\'ve explored but it is never utilized or explored. There are also some characters that just die for shock value which sucks as it feels like the show would be more interesting if they were kept alive.Overall, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling and exciting zombie show that unfortunately stumbles on all the subplots created. I did come out a little disappointed that they didn\\'t utilize everything the show introduced effectively but it was still a really good time. It does end with a potential tease for season 2 and it might resolve some of the remaining plot threads from season 1. The ending is also quite interesting and it does make me wonder what direction they could go in. Thus I am hopeful for a season 2 despite the show\\'s shortcomings.',\n",

It took a couple of episodes to get into the characters but the inter stories were compelling - the show runner my have made a mistake in killing off too many of the characters but the primary ones survived and might give Netflix enough to go with another season - the ending was intriguing and left the door open for a second season with a whole new direction - I will watch it if it does and recommend it for those that are into Zombie movies - my wife isn't but she has other really good qualities.\",\n",

I really love how it explores the characters, and their relationship of the people in the situation, because I think it really gives good character development and you really root for them. They're more than clichés and stereotypes.The situations and story are very character driven. I also love the concept for the beginning of the whole thing.I really love how ridiculously heroic and dramatic some of the action scenes are. You think that character should definitely be dead, but they'll heroically kung fu kick, and parkour their way out. It's also not affaid to kill anyone off and it's a really good mix of that.\",\n",
       "   'In the recent years Korean producers have been making good movies in the zombie sub-genre. Train to Busan, Netflix\\'s Kingdom series etc and now: All of Us Are Dead. There are 2 points that I wanna raise here.First things first, the zombie-actors are simply marvellous! Look at those kids!!! I think some are really recruited from kindergartens and they have excellent performances comparable to many adult actors/actresses. Pound for pound these kids can overshadow kids in Walking Dead series. No bias, but Koreans are catching up.And secondly, it\\'s the new concept. Precisely it\\'s not exactly new or original, but it\\'s rare in zom subgenre. Namely the \"asymptomatic\" zom. We\\'ve seen werewolves or vams or Hulk that can change form deliberately or casually or emotionally. But not always seen in zombies, yeah? I like this concept. Cool babe. It\\'s makes the story much more intriguing. U never know the one sitting next to u is a norm or a zom.What\\'s not that good then? Well, the mad science teacher. Yeah I know he has a very special background but, hey, look at him. He\\'s not convincing at all. I don\\'t mean he\\'s a bad actor, but he\\'s not that \"crazy scientist\" in all aspects. When I come to my senses I don\\'t even believe he has sufficient resources to make any significant accomplishment in cellular biology projects. No no no, not even an compelling argument.As a conclusion, I love this series very much. Guys pls give it a shot. If u r a zom fan like me, ask your gal/guy to sleep first and then binge-watch it overnight. Worth your every minute ;)',\n",
       "   \"I felt compelled to write a review just because someone compared this to High School of the Dead. This wasn't similar in any way.I actually think the zombies in this show were quite horrifying. I liked the depressing tone, the scary visuals, and the gore. I liked that anyone could die at any time. There were a lot of terrible decisions by the main cast, but overall I found this to be enjoyable.\",\n",
       "   'I like watching a good zombie movie or show from time to time. So I gave this show a chance after seeing the trailer. Overall I\\'d say it\\'s decent but has various problems as well.I think the acting overall is fine but I\\'ll say that I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. As always you may want to be careful with English dubs.Something I\\'ve noticed with Korean shows is that kids/students seem to be pretty nasty and unlikable overall. Is that a common thing in South Korea? You got bullies that actually are pretty nasty criminals and other kids that basically just go along with the bullies where no one speaks out. In addition you have a school where teachers and the principal are more focused on appearances than actually teaching the students. Well, maybe it really is reflecting real life...In this you then have a zombie outbreak scenario where to be honest I thought a lot of those characters deserved to die. The one good thing I want to mention is that the students call these things as what they are => zombies. I always get annoyed when shows try to be fancy by inventing new names for what clearly is a zombie (\"walkers\" for example). The police, soldiers and other officials never call them zombies though.The zombies overall are really inconsistent. Characters are either dying right away or will have a thick plot armor. The students in their capabilities are also very inconsistent. For the most part they will not really fight but run away. Then in some situation they seemingly suddenly mutate to combat and strategic experts just to then forget about that a few minutes later.There is focus on some characters which makes it appear they will play a bigger role later on and then they are just killed off with no real impact. Also the way the whole situation is resolved towards the end of the first season is a bit of a letdown. I guess they were trying to create a complete story in case they will not be renewed for a second season while still keeping the door open. The result is leaving me a bit unsatisfied.',\n",

Each episode is quite long but giving enough time to learn about each character and the situation they are in.Just as you think you have guessed what will happen a curve ball is thrown and it takes a different route to the one you were expecting. In summary this is a series about zombie survival - a story which is way over played - but there is something about the series which tackles the subject in a different way.Characters are killed off you wouldn't expect to be killed off... gore happens when you don't expect it to happen... and the overall surprise of it all makes 'All of Us Are Dead' compelling viewing.If you enjoy zombie survival films then give this a try. 8 out of 10!\",\n",

       "   \"This is a big budget, large cast, tightly-scripted zombie (near) apocalypse TV series written as a miniseries. I'm saddened to think that there might not be a season 2 since there was complete closure at series end.Very bingeable, great character depth and development as the series progresses. I had one problem with the series that keeps it from getting a higher rating (it's an 8 rating, a 10 rating for overall entertainment):There were too many scenes where the core group of students just stood there like deers caught in headlights, while a single member of the group did most of the battling. Also little prep, no weapons.It happened too often and it wasn't until a second older group of students emerged (senior class, the archers) that appeared more suited to surviving and behaved more like expected. They also understood the importance of arming themselves.I understand the paralyzing fear and their younger ages (+/- 16 years) being a factor. I understand that this is how any younger group might react (so it was well-written in this regard) but it was still frustrating to see this as an adult.Side note: This is the fifth South Korean TV series I've watched in the last few months. All (except 1) have been really good TV.Recommended (in no specific order):-- Hellbound / JioK-- Squid Game / Ojing-eo geim-- All of Us Are Dead / Jigeum Uri Hakgyoneun-- Sweet Home / Seuwiteuhomxx The Silent Sea (Failed for me)On my watch list:-- Glitch / Geullichi.\",\n",
       "   '\"All of Us Are Dead\" marks the latest high-budget Korean release from Netflix, fighting for room in a genre already groaning from the weight of the likes of \"Kingdom,\" \"Squid Game\" and \"Hellbound.\"Posh Hyosan High School and its affluent pupils think it\\'s going to be just another day of working towards tests and surviving the bullies, deadlines and awfulness of puberty that high school crams daily into 7 hours. But then one student comes stumbling in, claiming a teacher abducted her, and before lunch is over, the entire school, save for a handful of stragglers, will either be dead or dying.Netflix\\'s show sets up its premise well. The premier, having to do a hell of a lot of world building, manages to establish key characters and relationships without too much exposition, and finds some potential drama and tension it can explode apart later. Then the promise is fulfilled in episode 2, which begins with an absolute massacre in the school cafeteria as the confusion and fear of what is happening mixes with more blood than a Wes Craven film. Beautifully shot and well executed, it never lets the gas off the pedal.Sadly, the show then begins to fall under the weight of what it wants to do, and what it needs to do. We get four main threads to follow involving politicians and rescue services, a good natured police officer, and two main groups at the school. That\\'s not including the parents, other surviving school students or faculty, or secret services that need paid attention to, also. By episode 5, there\\'s so much going on (and so many barriers to any progress) that the momentum stalls and the show, despite the numerous chase scenes, resembles a dog chasing its tail.Further, the characters are just horrible. Not badly written, no, but evil, inconsiderate monsters. One may forgive them on account that they\\'re young, privileged and facing a fantastical problem, but even resident bully, Gwi-Nam, is just one of many monsters wearing people faces. It gets tiring to see the students sabotage and ruin one anothers\\' chances over and over again. Redemption is a banned word in this universe, and Neitzche would likely baulk at the pessimism on display.Lastly, the zombie virus is just too complicate to understand. In this world, some people don\\'t fully turn, allowing them to develop super powers while maintaining their identities. I don\\'t understand how a virus can increase strength and speed without boosting muscle mass, but here we\\'ve got kids going at each other like a Rita Repulsa monster smacking down the Power Rangers. Who gets this mutated virus is also arbitrary, with only three people getting this lucky dose (and obviously each is integral to the story).Still, when all is said and done, there\\'s some great fun to be had here. The first four episodes alone are worth catching, and as the kids\\' relationships take center stage in the middle, the cast prove proficient at being good dramatic actors. Even as it lags, there\\'s no denying it\\'s a treat to watch, with scenes of destruction exploding into zombie herds chasing down unlucky survivors. The tension, as threads are cut, snaps in a very satisying way. But, in the end, it\\'s five episodes too long, and plays the same cards too often to be as successful as, say \"Kingdom.\"',\n",

       "   \"The serie is quite fun to watch but it doesn't bring anything new or special, unfortunately because sometimes these kind of movies from South Korean production companies can be a hidden gem (i.e. Train to Busan). However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don't like that, don't bother to watch it. However, it doesn't meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie. I just hope that Netflix won't kill this serie and that it will order a 2nd season as the story got potential for another interesting zombie season.\",\n",
       "   \"I'm not giving this a rating because I've only lasted two episodes. The action scenes are very well done -- high school kids make wonderfully enthusiastic, energetic extras, whether they're twisting and twitching as man-eating zombies or frantically fleeing the same man-eating zombies.But the scenes without zombie action are ridiculously amateurish: stiff, slow, and lethargic. I began to lose patience when a bunch of high school students, having narrowly escaped the zombies that have overrun their school, feebly barricade themselves inside a classroom and stand around calmly musing how best to phone the police.The scene drags on like a slow dinner party. Two girls stare out the window and literally chat about their teenage relationships (one of them grinning impishly), while just a few feet away, separated by thin panes of glass, a mob of red-eyed students-turned-zombies wave and growl and hungrily gnash their teeth.Zombie movies are by definition silly. Still, if they're to work, the human characters in them should behave with at least some semblance of reality.\",\n",

       "   'Since I love the zombie genre and South Korean zombie shows (i.e. Train to Busan, Kingdom, etc) I knew I was gonna give this one a try. If you love guts, blood, and gore I can say this show has plenty of it! If you like whiny teens that make absurd decisions, well, unfortunately this show has plenty of that too! The premise is not unlike other types of zombie shows. A virus gets out and there starts the zombie outbreak. At least with this series, you know pretty much from the beginning how it started and then the why it started develops as things move along. I will say things get tedious when episodes end up with the same scenarios and stuff, so in my opinion, this series could have easily been 9 or 10 episodes instead of 12. Luckily, when the tedious parts occur or the whinny teens start up, the fast forward button comes in handy! The teens, and even adults, make the dumbest decisions in many cases. But, I guess that comes with the territory in all zombie shows and movies. The ending leaves the door wide open for a second season, but I don\\'t know how far they can take the idea of the \"different\" zombies (don\\'t wanna give anything away, but it\\'s a premise we have seen before.)

Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do. Please, next time write a zombie flick which the protagonists are aware of it and know what to do about it. It would be a refreshing story.Worth watching 8/10.\",\n",

Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted.',\n",

This is claustrophobia done right!I watched the English dub, so I can't comment so much on original dialog, but the dub was acceptable, and the actors certainly emote well.I have to knock off a couple points for some of the character choices/motivations that just don't make a lot of sense. We have a young lady infect/murder a kid because he's poor (I think?). We have a military leader that kills himself out of shame after bombing the hot zone? Other weirdness might be chalked up to my ignorance of Korean culture, but I don't really understand a girl beating a kid who professes his love to her, or the girl who wants to die because of some risque pictures being sent to classmates that are all already dead, and don't have access to their phones anyway?Finally, I think most of the 12th episode really just existed to leave things open for another season.

The mystery and thrill of the story does a good job to keep you glued to the screen, wanting to know what happens next. Although a lot of characters remain flat, I'm glad they aren't all so one-sided.My biggest gripes of this series are 1) how quickly they get rid of characters without giving them a chance to really make an impact or finish their stories 2) the frustrating decisions some characters make leading to dumb consequences (seems like a theme for a lot of horror/thriller movies, which could be fixed). 3) The color of blood on the costumes at times feel a bit too pink, but that's coming from someone who works in film. 4) The CGI feels very unrealistic at times, which takes you out of the film.

Although the scene of the Captain's escape and swimming away amidst a crazy barrage of bullets with only one bullet barely grazing him made me laugh... that's why you can't take this so seriously.

I don't know if the scriptwriter/director is dumb or this is all part of the plan that they're supposed to look stupid and act stupid. Overall nice series but not favorite as Kingdom, Train to Busan, #Alive, etc. Still it can be done better, definitely worth to watch but not worth to watch for the infinity.\",\n",

       "   \"Korean shows tend to be really hit or miss for me. Sweet Home, My Name, and Squid Game are all great shows with well-developed characters who act in a believable way given their situations. This show is definitely a miss for me though. The writing seems to focus only on making things dramatic; characters do terrible and dumb things for no discernible reason, since in many cases they haven't been developed enough. The kid on the roof who we barely know screws everyone over because... reasons? The Military commander is ruthlessly evil in some scenes and then in other scenes tries to take the high ground and and lament what they have to do, and it just doesn't feel coherent. The writers also forgot that humans need water to survive, even though one of the students says in one of the earlier episodes that they are already dehydrated. It even starts raining at one point and NOT ONE PERSON thinks to get a bucket or something and collect some drinking water. The EMS father finds a stockpile of guns and only brings one because ...? And then he gives his only gun away before he even gets to the school? Soooo much stupidity in this show. I could go on and on but you get the point. If all you want is drama and you don't care about character decisions making sense, then by all means give this show a go. But if you are the type who gets annoyed when characters behave in dumb or unbelievable ways, stay far, farrr away.\",\n",
       "   'First things first, this series has insane amount of gore. So it\\'s a warning, anyone who is sensitive or cannot tolerate gore should stay away from this series.When I finished 2 episodes of this series I thought, \"what is new? It\\'s that usual zombie survival series that Korea produces every year\". I felt it was like ALIVE but set in a school rather than apartment. Moving further into the series I realized, it is not usual.Zombie survival series are always interesting no matter how old they become. Having watched so many zombie based films/series, I now find those snarling open mouthed zombies absolutely hilarious. Either they look disgusting or they look hilarious.However, what makes this series so different from the other zombie ones are these:-1. The fact that it deals with the mental state of the bullied school kids who get no help or comfort, like how Eu-Jin wishes the school burns down and everyone gets killed after her being bullied. This results in grave consequences later in this series watch out for that.2. The fact that the zombie virus is justified this time. Most of the time we get only a faint detail of the infection but this time, through the videos of the professor, we get to witness a lot of details about the virus.3. The fact that the makers have decided to introduce a new kind of zombie into the series which later turns into a grave danger for all.There are many more new elements in this series and that\\'s a huge plus point for a genre that normally doesn\\'t get much different treatment.Loopholes, quite a lot including some really illogical scenes that I could not help but scratch my head at those points and the fact that the series is unnecessarily stretched. Each episode is about more than an hour long (honestly, it is just 1 hr on average considering credits start playing with 5 mins left at end) and there are 12 episodes. You really feel the drag when the student gang talk and share their feelings amongst themselves on a rooftop and these were some parts I genuinely skipped.Overall, I think the makers did a good job by introducing new unique elements into this zombie series otherwise I was ready to bash up this series left and right had it been that usual zombie survival series that are available in millions on Netflix.',\n",

I even completed reading the Web toon to get ready for the watch.But, it was kind of disappointing. I directly compared this drama to \"Happiness\", which is another Zombie centric drama that was aired just mere months ago. While \"Happiness\" had a lot of things right and had found a right balance between the Zombie action and human interactions, \"All of Us Are Dead\" was just mindless actions in most of the episodes. Sometimes quite repetitive to the point that we can easily predict the outcome.I liked the four leads, but other than the characters of Lee Cheongsan and Nam Ohjo which were built well, Lee Suhyeok and Choi Namra\\'s characters could have given much depth. Especially Namra\\'s who had the most interesting character arc. But hers was not explored till the last episode.Likewise there were so many things that fell short of expectations. Including the final explanation that the Webtoon carried. Anyhow, the drama is still enjoyable and the action is good. The settings and choreography are well done as well.Good effort.

The main characters were dull to me and I couldn't relate to any of them,especially Nam Ra.There were way too many foolish decisions that were only introduced for shock value and character development. I don't see myself revisiting this show unlike the others I've watched of its kind.\",\n",

These are absolutely painful.\",\n",

       "   'It\\'s not as bad and it\\'s not as good as people are saying.Some of the contrivances in this are just insane. Your suspension of disbelief has to be at an all-time high to excuse some of the characters ridiculous/poor decisions. Now, that doesn\\'t make it a bad show. BUT, it does mean you\\'ll be sat there yelling things like:\"Omg close the door behind you!\"\"Would you run, run, like seriously! RUN! You have so much time!\"\"Just tell her! Omg just tell him! Talk to each other!... OMG!\"Why are you still standing there? DO SOMETHING!\"\"Can no one see that? It\\'s right there, are these people blind?\"\"Wait at the end of the last episode he was about to... How is he... what?\"\"How do you kill these things? He shot it in its... but wait she shot it in the... wait what? Do you need to destroy the brain or not!? TELL ME!\"Now, if you can ignore all the times you\\'ll feel this way, WHICH WILL BE A LOT, it\\'s an okay zombie show. Initially I was worried about teen angst, I don\\'t like teen drama, it\\'s usually boring and revolves around people not saying things that could easily solve 90% of any and all problems. Luckily the show splits its focus from time to time, and we get to see some different groups of people dealing with very different situations. It\\'s a good break from the Teen angst and let\\'s us see glimpses of how the world is reacting to this situation. With that said, there is a lot of teen rubbish in here. I think if this were written a bit better, with less contrivances, and characters I actually cared about, I could\\'ve given it a higher score.I think if people are overly positive about this it\\'s probably due to the whole K-pop vibe people are on... Essentially, anything Korean gets a pass due to pop culture favouritism. Whereas, if people are overly negative, it\\'s potentially due to the cliched teen drama, contrivance filled writing and dumb character decisions that they can\\'t overlook for the sake of entertainment.Look, it\\'s no Kingdom. It\\'s no Train to Busan (THE 1ST ONE OMG that second movie was baaaad). But it\\'s an okay watch.Oh, the ending was kinda bad and the final episode dragged. Definitely could\\'ve been less episodes.If you\\'re already a zombie fan, you\\'ll find this okay, heck, you may even like it.

It wasn\\'t a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I\\'m not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I\\'m in the 5th episode right now, and so far I\\'ve felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there\\'s no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn\\'t use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you\\'ll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it\\'s well made, and it adopted the original story very well.Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It\\'s worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It\\'s well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie.',\n",

I binged squid game in a day but couldn't with this for various reasons, none of it being my lack of interest.It definitely gets some things from train of busan but that isn't bad because that's a great movie itself. I thought 12 episodes was going to be too long but would have liked another episode rather than a subtle hint that could lead to another season. It should end with the last episode.The thing that intrigued me the most is the zombie and the sets and how hard it must have been to put makeup on all of them and dress them accordingly and the effort of rehearsal to get some of these scenes done right. This absolutely deserves many awards. The acting from the kids is meh but everything else is top notch.\",\n",

And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it's better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?I'll still watch the shows because they're still a hell of a lot better than the American crap.\",\n",

It had everything you need, a great storyline from start to finish, excellent mind boggling graphics, excellent cast, emotion, gore, cringe, and edge of your seat scenes, adrenaline and more.Wow. Hollywood needs to wake up and take lessons from Korean shows! They are just on another level! I really hope there's a Season 2 for this show. I am totally hooked!\",\n",
       "   'If you are watching this show only for the gore (like some of the low ratings here), it is not for you.Yes, there are very bloody moments and somewhat unbelievable zombie sequences, but that is a mere fraction of what this show is aiming towards. Under the \"zombies\" and \"fighting\", there is excellent emotional tension and moral exploration. From the students to the officials, the implications of moral judgement are monumental to the progression of the plot. Within the inhumanness, the interactions of such characters entrance us into a somewhat first-hand view of their relationships, where the threats from the \"zombies\" are often side-lined. This led to a truly well rounded series. This is matched with a great musical score, good direction (mostly) and excellent performances all around.There are a few things I didn\\'t like. Firstly, there are many scenes where it feels alot like a soap opera. Characters freeze up way too often, and such moments are quite cliche.Secondly, the girls in this episode, (except one) are extremely sterotypical, and to an extent, useless. Most of them just stand around and whine, sometimes even when the group is being attacked. They after running two steps, they can\\'t get up, they sulk and cry instead of fighting back. I would like to see more women step up and become emotionally and physically strengthened.In general, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling show that often side-lines the blood and gore of a traditional zombie show for a emotionally charged and humane primary plot. It is at times stereotypical and cliché, but it is an excellent binge-watch. I had an excellent time watching it, its topping the Netflix charts, and I would certainly recommend it.',\n",
       "   \"The show doesn't pretend to be intellectual or sophisticated. It is straight up what a good classic zombie drama should be- packed with heart-thumbing action throughout, characters that one can relate to and despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and some really emotional & heartbreaking moments towards the end.\",\n",
       "   \"Last episode let it down with characters making stupid decisions to go after lost causes and having weak dialog. I think the show could have concluded on the 11th episode and I'd have been happy at that. At the best of times the show was frustrating watching characters bicker with each other in life and death situations or seeing them needlessly sacrifice themselves.Another particularly frustrating thing to see was Nam-Ra only utilise her strength in the last episode when she could have done more in previous episodes to help the group.Also at times it was very convenient how dozens zombies would be chasing characters in one scene, and then in the next scene it wouldn't show how the characters had somehow outran them, the particular scene coming to mind is Onjo's father in the stairwell during the evacuation of the politicians.Some things I really liked: the virus origin story, it was refreshing to see a different take with a zombie virus that could be explained. And with a sad story behind it. I also really enjoyed the setting of most of it taking place in the school. The show was very tense at times, and the setting really added to it.I really liked Park Mi-Jin, her bratty attitude and lines were very funny. And Onjo's father and his undying will to save his daughter really added the sad drama to the show.The show also created some very good characters which you want to see fall, and it delivers on that front as well.Overall while not a perfect show, it is very entertaining and delivers a fresh addition to the zombie genre. Hopefully that is the show done because I wouldn't want to see them make another season.\",\n",
       "   \"I'll keep it short, the film is action-packed and thrilling - minus the first episode. So you really have to live through the pilot where the writers basically wanted the viewers to get a sense of the show's mood. Honestly, it felt a little unnecessary... Nevertheless, the succeeding episodes were heart-pumping. I didn't want to stop watching at 3 am.Anyway, the problem is not if it lives up to Train to Busan, because of course it won't. Different setting, tone and character focus. But the issue is how the writers only make characters likeable the moment they're about to cut them off.Believe me, I love an emotional character death but to kill of the interesting ones that the audience root for at such an early stage is just annoying. At least semi-develop the other nobodies before killing the charming ones. Other than that, the show's pretty good.I have to comment the casting too. I don't know Korea's standards but WOW everyone's so good. Even the random child saved by the police had great acting skills. So yeah, that made the experience more terrifying.Hoping for season 2. 💪🏻 Give me someone to root for from episode 1 to... at least episode 5-6.\",\n",

The half girl zombie too, she did an amazing job of being first a victim, then a killer, props to both actors.The other kids too, great chemistry from such a diverse cast, their differences and similarities are well defined.But, be prepared, anyone can die at any time, don't get too attached to any one character.

Sometimes, the parasite kills or even eats its host. But death of the host isn\\'t the freakiest goal. A parasite might get its host to die in a certain place, or be eaten by a certain creature. In order to accomplish these tricks, some parasites have evolved the ability to hack into the host\\'s brain and influence its behavior in very specific ways.How do parasites turn insects and other animals into the walking almost-dead? Every parasite has its own method, but the process usually involves altering chemicals within the victim\\'s brain. Researchers are working hard to identify which chemicals are involved and how they end up so bizarrely altering their host\\'s behavior.Brains, brains! Ant brains!A fungus doesn\\'t have a brain. And worms and single-celled critters obviously aren\\'t very smart. Yet somehow they still control the brains of larger, and smarter, animals.\"It blows my mind,\" says Kelly Weinersmith. She is a biologist who studies parasites at Rice University in Houston, Texas. She is particularly interested in \"zombie\" creatures. True zombies, she points out, aren\\'t exactly like the type you find in horror stories. \"In no way are these animals coming back from the dead,\" she says. Most real zombies are doomed to die - and some have very little control over their actions.The horsehair worm, for instance, needs to emerge in water. To make this happen, it forces its insect host to leap into a lake or swimming pool. Often, the host drowns.Toxoplasma gondii (TOX-oh-PLAZ-ma GON-dee-eye) is a single-celled creature that can only complete its life cycle inside a cat. But first, this parasite must live for a time in a different animal, such as a rat. To ensure this part-time host gets eaten by a cat, the parasite turns rats into cat-loving zombies.In Thailand, a species of fungus - Ophiocordyceps - can force an ant to climb almost exactly 20 centimeters (about 8 inches) up a plant, to face north and then to bite down on a leaf. And it makes the ant do this when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. This provides ideal conditions for the fungus to grow and release its spores.Biologist Charissa de Bekker wants to better understand how that fungus exerts that mind control over the ants. So she and her team have been studying a species related to the Ophiocordyceps fungus in Thailand. This U. S. cousin is a fungus native to South Carolina. It, too, forces ants to leave their colonies and climb. These ants, though, bite down on twigs instead of leaves. This is likely due to the fact that trees and plants in this state lose their leaves in the winter.De Bekker began these studies at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. There, her team infected a few species of ant with the South Carolina fungus. The parasite could kill all of the different ants she introduced to it. But the fungus made plant-climbing zombies only out of the species that it naturally infects in the wild.To figure out what was going on, de Bekker\\'s team collected new, uninfected ants of each species. Then, the researchers removed the insects\\' brains. \"You use forceps and a microscope,\" she says. \"It\\'s sort of like that game Operation.\"The researchers kept the ant brains alive in small Petri dishes. When the fungus was exposed to its favorite brains (that is, ones from the ants that it naturally infects in the wild), it released thousands of chemicals. Many of these chemicals were completely new to science. The fungus also released chemicals when exposed to unfamiliar brains. These chemicals, however, were completely different. The researchers published their results in 2014.The experiments at Penn State by de Bekker\\'s team were the first to create ant zombies in the lab. And the researchers only succeeded after setting up artificial 24-hour cycles of light and darkness for the zombies and their parasites.It will take more work to learn how the parasite\\'s chemicals lead to zombie behavior in ants. \"We are very much in the beginning of trying to figure this out,\" says de Bekker. She now studies ant zombies at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. There, she is now probing how that daily cycle of sunlight and darkness affects zombification.',\n",

But the physicality and action within the school were still ten times better than some of the stuff churned out in the US or Europe.It didn't shirk away from violence and wasn't afraid to kill off key characters - although you could argue it was a bit too keen at times. Maybe some of the side stories didn't really go anywhere, but they at least broke up the main focus so it didn't become too claustrophobic in one location, and even then you felt the whole of the school was utilised to give it a sense of scale.Things I liked:Good charactersGood set pieces and effectsGenuine interest in where the story was goingMain quibbles:The origin story of the virus was a bit ridiculousIs it realistic that the infected would just stay within that specific area and it wouldn't spread further?Apart from the school why are there never zombie children in the streets?

The show goes to a crawl in some of the initial episodes. Extremely slow episodes with 1h10 run time is crazy. It also completely goes overboard with the clickity-clack loud sounds on the transformations earlier on, too many, too often, too frequently for too long.I won't go into stupid character decisions as plot devices, or the absurd emotional philosophical talks whilst zombies are about to overrun you, or the fact they repeat the 'person transforming into zombie in front of you and everyone watches eagerly' 3 or 4 times in the first episodes, since it's part of a typical zombie show, those are all 'acceptable' as is.Had this show been properly edited, or cut, with a lower, but more relevant run time, and it would have been a sensational hit.

Also its very interesting as an American to see some of the sensibilities of youth in Koreas culture. Very different. I need another season right away. So addictive.

Most of the characters and events are predictable, there's no surprises.Still, it is a decent show to watch, but I had to fast forward lot of boring stuff.There are way better Korean TV series out there!

The way Korean girls run is always clumsy with their hands down. Girls always yell on guys for no reason, they never yell on them etc.There are also some unreasonable things that bothered me, like not looking for food, water nor toilet in days.But all in all, i would recommend this movie to those who specifically like this genre as there are some unique and never-seen before ideas. Hopefully producers of other future zombie movies will pay attention and develop on that, as zombie genre really needs this kind of refreshment, to move away from boring and simplified 'chase and kill' action.\",\n",

But reminded myself these are just a bunch of kids who are supposed to be 15-17 years old. In addition, this is happening in an Asian society so a lot of decision makings are just different from kids who are in a western country.The Character developments are okay. We see different types so it'll be easy for people to recognize themselves in the kids.Some comedic moments are added to the show to lighten it.

The script is OK - if you're watching with English dub, and the direction and editing are worthy of note but, at the end of the day, this is just another example of a production attempting to instill the idea that humans are violent.Episode 4 spells it out, without trying to hide it.Humans are inherently bad, so life without a governing body is wrought with danger.Whatever happened to the idea - possibly born in the 60's, or earlier - that humanity is inherently good?There are only a very small minority who find satisfaction in causing harm to the rest. Most humans would rather love their neighbour, not hate.Good idea for a show, if you're not bored with zombies, but we should all long for the day when writers realise that the public are not idiots, who fall for the idea that every human has evil at heart. Or is this just an attempt to make every human evil, whether they intend to be or not?It isn't just Hollyweird trying this approach, apparently.Try harder, Korea.

The engine is chugging with proper tension, low on melodramatic scenes.Unfortunately the second half of the show, especially after the reveal of the halfbies, is rife with melodramatic scenes and long drawn out shots trying desperately to make the viewer sad. Very cheap tactics are used multiple times. (Parents of girl X die, mother of boy Y dies, and father of girl Z dies.)Another disappointment is the asymptomatic angle. It is never explored further than to find a tactic to lure zombies with high pitch noise. The last we see of the second halfbie is the lab being wiped clean.Initially I thought the halfbie angle could be interesting but it is never properly explored, except to serve us a recurring 80's Hollywood enemy. In the end I think they should have toned down the halfbie angle and gone with a more interesting approach of how to deal with asymptomatic carriers.

There always are exceptions with ridiculously funny Zombieland and masterfully directed Train to Busan( which is by far my favourite zombie movie).For a series the 1 hour mark was daunting for me as an hour is almost half the runtime of a movie. But after the 1st episode I was hooked so if you are scared of the runtime don't worry if you finish the 1st episode you'll want to watch the next and then next. It however feels like a commitment.The story as we can except from a kdrama was top notch, except the ending. The motivation was spot on for the development of the zombie virus( not a spoiler as that's how it's). Though the science behind it I'm a little iffy about it, however emotionally it made sense. The friendships throughout the series were so good like there was a rollercoaster of emotions involved. An irritating villain who just keeps coming back. The heartlessness of people we have to depend upon, and the will to survive. I wanna make a special note that the romance is so adorable and beautiful that you want to protect all of the ships but the world it's set-up is so cruel that you end up broken anyways. Which brings me to the ending, as the show came to a close certain deaths seemed like they just happened to be killed to attain a certain route without any development which made those deaths cheap. Also after such a harrowing experience, you'd expect a good/wholesome ending but even that was stripped from us, so basically PAIN + PAIN.Characters were amazingly written. Like always whenever a zombie movie starts you bey on who's gonna survive, I did that too. Most of my guesses were right but I was surprised to see which one of them. As i have said you'll feel the beautiful friendships, you'll feel the romance which then will intensify the pain. Although certain characters were so useless that they just randomly died and no one from the cast seemed to care later. I found it funny and as a glitch as all the characters were saying they gotta be like a family. So that's a negative. Some moves weren't very logical and I should expect that with zombie movies but when other aspects are so good you end up expecting more. Like there's a scene where a laptop is supposed to be procured it was alright but it had unnecessary tension build up. After that scene we got into the human emotions stuff and that made me forget that scene. But still.Sound design is very well. The way background music can convert a scene from terrifying in a moment to comedy is pretty good. Music plays amazing role in the emotions that we see on screen. Romance, comedy, horror, friendship, sadness, despair everything.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to watch this series, it took me about 2 days to finish it but you can finish it in one. The end is unsatisfactory but you'll still enjoy it. Hope a sequel is released ( which probably will not since it's a Korean series which are mostly limited).Thanks for reading. See you later✌\",\n",

The concious Zombie concept which is an inspiration from \"Zack Snyders - The Army of the Dead\". This consious Zombies are really a different kind in the script and does create good value to the usual story.The names were really tough to go through atleast for the 5 or 6 episodes and after several deaths, I can remember the last batch of 8 names. Just for fun - Nam Ra, Haeyuk, Chiang, Yong Sue and many moreeeeeee...There was more fun involved as well like the youtuber,the policman and the leg injured guy.The deaths of the well developed characters are expected always - that will be the weseries trend for the past years.The ending again leaves lead to part two and as usual I do wait for the nexr season.

       "   'One of the recent Korean productions quickly positioned itself among the most popular in Mexico. I already know why. It starts as \"Zombie Station\" (also Korean) and ends as \"RBD\" (typical Mexican teen drama soap opera).What a big disappointment and what a waste of time after chapter 2!The pace of the script is truly stressful, something that should be caused by the zombie chases and the inevitable spread of the virus.The characters live between regrets, like teenagers, but even adults behave as if they were incapable of having developed emotional intelligence. So many tears distract them from the need to strategize, strengthen alliances, and basically run away instead of mindlessly fighting monsters.It is not a dystopian world, they well know that zombies die with the destruction of the brain and go to war like cavemen with stones and sticks.Something that really bothers me is the denial of science, from the fact that a resentful teacher can create a virus in his room without the rigor of a laboratory, to the lack of contagion patterns... some of them reach superpowers and others simply run to bite whoever they catch.The story provokes in the viewer the constant desire that everyone die for idiots! They all deserve to die.Netflix invested a lot of money in digital production and post-production, they would have paid better writers instead.In other hand, it is a good portrait of school violence. Many of the problems that occur in history are rooted in abuses of power, bad influences, and inequities between social classes. There are many examples of social degradation, such as \"Lord of the Flies\" or \"The Beach\".It started with five stars but in the end it only deserves three.',\n",
       "   \"I can't believe how good this series turned out to be.I love zombie movies/series but in recent years, my standards got to a very low level, as there were not many good contents in this type.All of Us Are Dead proved, that if they want, they can absolutely put together a show full of excitement.It was fast paced, exciting and emotional from the beginning til the end. If you are a zombie fanatic, you definitely should watch this.Sure, there were some mistakes and errors, but which undead movie doesn't?\",\n",
       "   \"Stupid character decisions ruin shows. In this one for example they all know what zombies are and they even reference Train to Busan. So why on earth wouldn't they try to armour themselves up, like wrap their arms and legs with books, get some sharp objects as weapons, stop yelling unnecessarily, stop trying to prevent people from killing bitten people etc.Nam-ra's character was annoying and I don't know why they made her the focus. The dads plotline was also pointless.There's many storylines that were unnecessary or frustrating like the bully that kept falling from the building. The zombie human girl should havr also been going around and stabbing all the zombies one by one and clearing out areas before the rest moved out. Missed opportunity and they didn't have the best strategies. That final zombie battle out in the open with spades was also super ridiculous and stupid decision making. The writers should have made them at least take high ground.Oh yeah also why wouldn't the archery students be collecting their arrows as much as possible. They need all the arrows they can get. They would have used the arrows and gone around stabbing the zombies one by one through the tennis cage or something like that. Like daryl did in the walking dead. So many missed opportunities that zombie lovers would have wanted to see.\",\n",
       "   \"'All of us are dead' is the latest Korean sitting on top in Netflix shows which have been dominated by Koreans for a couple of months in most countries. Whether you are familiar with K-drama or you are just getting to know about it after the #squidgame pandemic and giving it a chance just like me, this show has so much to tell. The plot is not perfect and has a lot of holes in it that some of it will be probably answered in next season, however, for someone with a lot of Zombie movies, shows, and games experience, the characters seemed a bit stupid at the start, some of the deaths are badly written. But when you stop comparing them to let's say badass characters of other shows like #Thewalkingdead, they seem a lot more realistic. So bear that in mind that these characters are just a bunch of high school kids with no experience or proper weapon at hand. The story starts with a virus outbreak in a high school and covers a lot of different characters without a leading role. With all the explanations 'All of us are dead' has a messy but proper and thrilling plot. The casting is good. I believe that most of the actors & actresses are new faces but they did the job quite well. CG and computer effects are good mostly but in a few scenes, it's not very clean. The soundtracks and sound effects are good and it brings a sense of fear to the show. The opening is one of the positive points and it's innovative.Overall, 'all of us are dead' is a brutal and thrilling zombie show with an acceptable plot and good choice of cast. If you are looking for a fun zombie show that tastes like K-drama, it can be a good choice for you.\",\n",
       "   \"This show brings absolutely nothing new to the zombie genre and falls for all the same pitfalls zombie movies from 2002 fell for.Zombies in drama teenage school with a little bit of bullying undertone but nothing ever feels like a _complete story_.It's just a string of events and 1 dimensional comic book-like characters who serve exactly one purpose: the sad girl, the maniac bully, the fat kids who loves chicken. It's almost satire.Entertaining background noise but I can't help to think - was this conjured by an AI?\",\n",
       "   \"Is this a great zombie outbreak show? Yes. Is it plauged by the occasional cheesy comic relief cliches at points? Also Yes. But this show goes so much further than that. In the end it's less about the zombies and more about the horrific trauma the outbreak inflicts on everyone involved. It shows the perspective of survivors as well as rescuers and military. No one is spared from the effects of this nightmare and nothing is black and white. It's honestly tough to watch at times and nauseating to see what these people have to go through, but it's refreshing in the sense that it isn't just a mindless hack and slash zombie flick and actually deals with tragedy as well as moral and ethical dilemmas. Highly Recommend.\",\n",

There must have been 3-4 episodes where nothing happens and they just move about from room to room making the same mistakes. Infuriating.Zero payoff at the end too.\",\n",
       "   \"Good premises of a zombie apocalypse setup. Generally good acting but the whole coming-of-age mixed in really dragged down the show.It's zombie apocalypse we do not have time for young brats' love quarrel and other emotional stupidity. Many parts we fast-forwaded to skip the boring cheesy moment that are suppose to be emotional. They felt completely out of place. Lot of sub-plots were not done in enough details and felt like just fillers.And I meant it is a zombie apocalypse show we are not expecting it to be 100% realistic, but when you have the main casts happily chatting with each other after two-three days of no water and food, zombies suddenly chase flare for no reason, and certain roles took forever to fully turn into zombie after being bitten, you know something is wrong about the script.\",\n",
       "   'I liked Train to Busan so when they said that a new Korean zombie show was coming out I was really excited. The trailer looked good and I\\'m for TV series over movies to tell a big story all day any day. I thought it was cool that they had some scientific explanations for the zombie outbreak and not just \"it started\". It was also cool to have 12 hours to cover surviving a zombie apocalypse rather than 2 in a movie. But the show really fell flat.For starters, the plot was really ridiculous at times. The virus origin story was just \"what\"? So the teacher\\'s son was bullied, and instead of protecting him, moving him to another school, finding ways to prove the bullies\\' guilt, using his status as a teacher to push for punishment, signing him up for self defense classes and basically everything rational... he injects his son with a new virus he just created? I\\'m impressed he was able to contain his son and wife at home without getting hurt himself btw. Then when the virus broke out his actions were really inconsistent. He was agitated at first when finding out that the student he chained up was released. But then he took centuries to explain everything. Also he sent the cop to his computer to retrieve the solution when it was just \"burn them all\"? I was really hoping this character would be developed and utilized more, since the scientific side of a zombie virus is pretty interesting and would\\'ve separated this series from other zombie shows.Moving on, the characters that we follow are mostly not very likable. There were some actors that were horendous at acting too. Zombie in your face and these kids just poker face... I get that these kids are just teenagers, but it\\'s a zombie apocalypse, one of the kids actually mentioned Train to Busan in episode 1 or sth, lets get to work with building up defenses, armoring up, finding resources, figuring out what\\'s going on outside... can we save the meaningless squabbles and love triangle drama for later? The kids also act very dumb at times. Can we throw an infected person out of the room before they actually become a zombie and get another person bitten? Yes I can imagine it being tough when it\\'s a friend or family, but sometimes they really go over the top with it and just makes the characters seem stupid and irrational. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists were particularly well written, and I can\\'t help feeling that the writer had something against women in general. I get that Asia\\'s gender expectations are more traditional, but most of the females just cowered behind while the guys did all the work. Like seriously? You need the guys to tell you to help them push and not just sit behind and watch?Half way through the series become more about the conscious \"half zombies\" than the rabid thrashing ones, which is okay, but the subplots were quite underwhelming too. The bully\\'s obsessed with the male lead. The bullied girl decides that the person she wants to avenge the most is... the guy that tried to comfort her at the rooftop? Class president gained these super powers and couldn\\'t die anymore... and she couldn\\'t do anything to help? Like go out, find a safe path, find food & water? It\\'s like having Spiderman with an invisibility buff on your team and he does almost nothing. They spent half an episode on making toilets, a much more mundane matter that nobody asked for.I wanted to like the series. I really did. I watched it as soon as it came out, but in the end it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn\\'t terrible, it was a thrill to watch people run away from the zombies, but many of the times when they weren\\'t actively fighting or escaping the zombies ended up pretty frustrating.',\n",
       "   \"The series wasn't toooo bad but it could've been done in eight parts instead of twelve. At the midpoint it started dragging on way too much first with the group assembling in the choir room lamenting and arguing, then the roof for two episodes, lamenting and arguing, then we got a little action as they moved from the roof to the closet in the gym, and we had to spend time with them crying, lamenting and arguing some more for an episode and a half. Looord snooze fest. As diverse and fleshed out as the main characters were they weren't all that likable or interesting. I loved when they shared a candy bar in the closet as if they hadn't eaten in weeks when only 24 hours had gone by since the infection started.Then the one antagonist kept getting pushed out windows and pushed off the roof and then he kept coming back so that plot point got a little stale. I think if I had zombie superpowers the last thing I would care about is my missing eye and getting revenge for it. After all, his body was crunched, twisted, bit, smashed, mashed... he looked like hell so why was he worried about his eye for?I think this would've been a lot better if they had only trimmed the melodramatic repetitive fat and kept it to six episodes.Anywho...\",\n",

I watched the version with Korean audio and English subtitles so MAYBE a lot got lost in the translation? But still... it was painful to watch. It went on and on and on... was it a zombie horror? Teen drama? None. It was like creators couldn't decide.\",\n",

I sat there and repeated \"please don\\'t be stupid and say \"zombies are attacking students at my school\".\" and then the student brings up Train to Busan, which you should watch if you haven\\'t yet. So far this is a good zombie series.Some points off for writing and pacing but still good.',\n",

I frequently was yelling at the screen wondering why would you do that in a literal life or death zombie apocalypse situation??? Like their choices just didn't seem realistic for this high stake scenario. But then I learned more about the sewol ferry accident and the depressing truth is that the choices of the adults accurately reflect reality.

People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.Each episode delivers and even though they're a bit longer than usual, they don't feel tedious. When there's no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.The characters are horror flick typical but they're smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they're still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they're actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time.

I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie 'transformations', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are...CGI doesn't look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show.

It\\'s like taking a bland dish and adding the right spices to it to make an even better dish; sorry DOTD fans, I still love DOTD, but it\\'s no longer my favorite apocalypse film; it will go down in history as the best of it\\'s time.I am a huge fan of the Beastars. Just an FYI, I know that this film takes place in Korea while the Beastars Netflix Series takes place in Japan, but the High School setting; the mystery theme of who or what is behind a killing, the character\\'s voices/mannerisms and even their uniform remind me of the Beastars; the hero dude Cheogsan who has a secret crush on Onjo reminds me of Legoshi and Haru for instance.This is hands down the BEST zombie-apocalypse movie-series of all time. I call it a movie series because the episodes are like movie segments, that really don\\'t feel like they\\'re a hour long. It\\'s absolutely hilarious too. I\\'ve so far watched 3 episodes. I would hate to spoil it for those who want to see a Sci-Fi masterpiece that still managed to be original. The character arcs are gripping, and you grow an attachment to the main characters really quickly.Since it\\'s full of gore, I\\'d say it\\'s best fit for ages 17 and up.In many ways, the zombie-virus reminds me of COVID, but is way worse than covid; Contagion\\'s virus was eerily just like coronavirus too, but again not as terrifying as the one on this show. Made me think, \"Maybe Covid isn\\'t so bad,\" and the importance of our modern-day technology!The animation is intense, so-much-so that you forget this is just a movie. If you watch it long enough, you actually start to feel there; the makeup and animation is simply so compelling. Immediately, when you begin to watch it, you\\'re HOOKED. You\\'ll feel empathy, fear, suspense, and amusement AT ONCE. Every single character on here is interesting and talented; both the actors on the screen, and the voice-over actors; you can\\'t even tell that it\\'s a voice over, and I really had to study their lip movements, which still seem to be in sync; you seriously WON\\'T notice it very much at all.You\\'ll be determined to see what happens to all of them, and if they make it out because the title itself just draws people in. It is brilliant. Every single shot and angle is perfectly paced in line with the story. I never feel like characters stall or are dragging the time, like I\\'ve seen with even some Disney+ Originals; move aside Disney and take some notes, because Netflix Originals did it AGAIN with another masterpiece.It is bound to jerk some tears of sadness or shock, or make you cry laughing. You seriously can\\'t get bored with this one - even I can\\'t and I am attention-deficient. This is definitely binge-watchable if you can stomach the realisticness of the gore and suspense. Sometimes I even forgot that the characters can\\'t hear me through the screen when they\\'re unbeknowst of a zombie\\'s approaching.

Also, weren't those soldiers trained? How did they miss shooting him so badly that he was only hit randomly underwater? They should've lit him up profusely before he even touched the water.

That happened many many times.And many others situation are actually hard to watch.The Adults acting is actually very bad too.Like l said before its a shame because they had all to make this great.And instead they made everyone useless and no charismatic at all.I couldn't have any sympathy with any of them at all.Please try to make it a little realistic at least a little this was sad.\",\n",

They simply became too annoying from half-way and on. I got so infuriated with the teenagers whining and arguing to no end. The whole season was like watching a cat fight. I can see one or two brash characters, but almost all of them either physically or mentally abuse one other. Is that Korean culture for kids to act that way? There are barely any redeemable quality any of the teens possessed. And some plots dragged for far too long like Gwami and the suicidal girl (forgot her name). She is the perfect character to be redeemed; to do something that mattered to the plot in a positive way. Sadly they made her an even more of a depressing villain. It's sad to say, but I kind of wished all of the kids turned at the end. They were that badly written.\",\n",

There are back stories for most students and their cooperation is tantamount to their survival.The zombie chase scenes are fast paced and mostly believable. There are also poignant moments to change the pace along with some slower tense horror elements.

The action is almost constante and relentless, but they still find time to work some effective and really well written drama, excellent characters and even some goofy comedy scenes.There's a lot to love here, but I think what really makes this show works is the characters. In a similar vein to Stranger Things' first season, they managed to create some really compelling and emotionally engaged cast of characters. The teenagers are not unsufferable assholes like in most shows, instead they feel like real people, with real issues and strenghts, and you really want to see them succeed and escape.It's one of those shows merely talking about it doesn't really does it justice. It can even sound kind of dumb in paper, but once you see it action on the screen, you get mesmerized. The people behind this show really pulled off some bold and creative ideas that many other would've easily screw up.Especial credits must be given to the young cast of actors, who not only have stellar dramatic performance, but also some incredibly physical stunt work and zombie sequences.The only downsides I can think of are some (very) minor plot holes and the fact that the show does get a little tiny bit repectitive.

Also, that, at dangerous moments, it's love and hope that binds us together.Jumping to the ending scene, it's nice that it has ended with giving hope that not everyone that we saw dead is actually dead.

The government that is actually competent, the original (as far as I know) idea of halfbies and the fact that's it not in the US made me hope for a unique take on a zombie show.However, this show falls into the same mistakes as so many of its competitors: illogical decisions and behaviour by the survivors. It tires me to think how many times this show did the thing where everybody stand around the person who is, as everyone is very aware of, about to turn into a zombie, but instead of taking advantage of the zombies weakness before it fully turns, they stare at it with mouths wide open. This stands among many plot holes and issues I had with the show, from very general things like the dumb self-sacrifices to specific things like the forest hiking sequence in the last episode where On-Jo follows the golden ribbons. I don't think I have to explain why that scene was ridiculous.Going into this show, I was excited for a good take on a zombie show and was, in most aspects, disappointed.\",\n",

I\\'m generally not a fan of media that have to do with zombies but this is one I actualy enjoyed quite a bit.The action scenes worked really really well and must have been quite hard to film with all the chaos happening in each scene and how many zombies were there attacking and running. I found all those scenes very impressive and genuinely had me at the edge of my seat.The soundtrack of the series isn\\'t all that much but in a show like this where you constantly run around that doesn\\'t really mean it\\'s that big of a deal. The actors did a really good job as well, no complaints in that aspect.Now when it comes to the writting of this series, you can more or less understand (mostly) where the show is going. They need to find a cure for the virus and as always there are people that are somehow kind of immune to it which did disappointed me as it is a plot tool used in every zombie-themed movie.The main \"villain\", Gwi Nam was indeed threatening but seeing him rise so many times after getting hit and thrown off the building I laughed and found it silly almost. Also, I am certain that when he first killed a zombie (stabbing it on the throat) some blood got in his mouth so given the events that continued he should have turned into a zombie at that point already. Another thing I\\'d like to point out that didn\\'t make sense to me was what they did with Na-yeon. I expected she\\'d turn into half a zombie as Gwi Nam bit her but that didn\\'t happen and even though I hated her as a character I did want to see something more be done with her character.Last I want to point out my biggest problem with the series. It took me too many episodes to start caring about the characters. I didn\\'t want them to get killed but I didn\\'t care enough either. Half the reason is probably because teenagers act as teenagers but the romance parts felt very unnecessary at times and really made the show slow down and made the situation with the zombie apocalypse seem less important to the characters which I found ridiculous.Were there too many deaths? Yes. Were they unnecessary? Some of them. For example Onjo\\'s father which ended up being my favorite character. I found him the most grounded character in the whole show and was really disappointed to see him die the way he did after all that development. Development is essential for me to make a death actually impactful but with him I felt like he was killed off just to keep our main characters the kids.',\n",

Watching someone turn for the 6th time, in the same dramatic way, without previously building an emotional connection to those characters is played out by the 3rd episode.Most of the situations are handled borderline moronic, and the consistency of the plot is reminiscent of a wet fart.The worst of it was suffered by the dialog. It was either written by a computer, or a person who\\'d previously had very little social interaction with others.If I\\'d have to come up with key-words that best describe the show, they would be: inconsistent, borderline comedic, dragged out and non-sensical.I still can\\'t decide if this was intended to be a comedy or a satire of the zombie genre, because it definitely can\\'t be taken serious as horror/drama. And the show is self aware of what it\\'s trying to do, as its characters reference the far better executed Train to Busan in more then once.I\\'m aware that it\\'s a zombie movie, so it\\'s a \"turn your brain off\" kind of viewing, but this show puts absolutely no effort into trying to take itself serious even within it\\'s own imaginary world.This would have worked 100% better as an animated feature considering the cartoonish characters situation handling and presentation.',\n",

Also, instead of running on the road, why wouldn't they just hide in an empty house? Moreover, they decided to fight the zombies with sticks and hammer? Okay Thor. And the mom is the dumbest by entering a field full with infected and called the obviously infected and get eaten. She deserved it. The father of the female lead went through a lot to find her daughter just to have a less than a minute scene with her. Also, there are too many self reflecting scenes among them. Honestly, we don't care. Last but not least, the director could've just utilized the halfbies (The bully and Nam Ra) characters more.

What this leads to is a predictable sequence of events, but unpredictable character deaths (except for 2).The acting is as believable as it is enjoyable and there\\'s only a little amount of wooden characters (which is a really good aspect of in show.)It\\'s pretty safe to say that the target audience is a group of high schoolers because the constant emotional drama (that seem to be not very important and just there) between the characters might bore the average viewer.This is a modern and entertaining addition to the genre and worth binging for those itching for more zombie action.

Also it does portray how I imagine a real apocalypse would look like where people die on regular basis regardless how much we root for them not to. However the last couple of episodes appear to be quite repetitive with similar set pieces and situations. Also the main villain and his interaction with the surviving students is just a tiny bit annoying for the reasons you will have to see for yourself.

Or this drama is about a character\\'s life story then other dramas about other characters lives\\' story is not innovative because both are telling life stories about a character.I am a huge zombie fan, and have watch most of the zombie shows/movies.Obviously the premise is the normal zombie premise but what made the show differentiate from the rest, is the other elements added into it such as character depths, morals, love, hope, hate and friendship. There are characters that will make you laugh, cheer for, like, hate and also get annoyed at. Which in itself is a success because it made you feel that way.It also had twist and turns that are not used in many other zombie flicks. And I have to say as an avid zombie veteran, I was taken by surprise more than a handful of scenes. (Which is not easy at all since I have seen most of them.) And if it managed to make you immediately want to click on the next episode to see what happens next, it has also succeeded.Yes, it got it\\'s bad moments sometimes, can be slow, stupid decisions are made and also a few plot holes. But those are forgiven in the grander scheme of things. The cinematography was beautiful, zombies really well made, acting was amazing by such young actors and action sequences realistically done.

I love how they included the youtuber character because he's not just for comedy but it's a reality that people would do stupid thing just for social media views.I like how they got into detail of the origin of the virus and the mechanism of the virus. Most zombie movies don't go into detail with the origin of the virus (usually it's chemical spill and things like that).Each episode keeps you wanting more and the actors played their parts perfectly. The female protagonist, On-Jo is a very realistic character. She's not one of those badass superhero frontal heroine but like most of us, she's an ordinary girl who has to deal with the pain of losing loved ones and yet keep going for the ones who are still alive.This show isn't just about surviving or killing zombies. It shows you every human relationship. In this show, although they show you how cruel humans can be, it also highlights the good side of humans and how one is willing to sacrifice for the good of others.The side stories are all put together very well, without spoiling the main plot.

       "   \"First moment, it started well but by going end of it, it becomes miserable Korean emotional drama.I couldn't understand characters, I couldn't understand their decisions. Over actings against their families and friends made feeling so stressed.Too much dramas for zombie action. The original webtoon was kind of this, but they shouldn't apply this kind of unnecessary things.And why they chose those bad actors?\",\n",
       "   \"It's unsurprising that another excellent show tackling the zombie genre has tumbled out of South Korea, yet again showing us that the undead category is still alive and kicking.I can sing this shows praises to the moon and back with truly excellent camerawork focusing on complex wide sweeping shots condensing down into close ups all in one take, not to mention a clearly competent directorial team on deck. The setting is, although fairly overdone in zombie media (a high school), showcased to us in a fairly fresh and interesting way, with plenty of background building before the main outbreak occurs and a very in depth look at the good and bad already occurring at the school.That being said I absolutely need to address the few issues this show has sadly, they aren't small. While the acting is decent enough to not ruin the immersion, actually on the contrary it ranges from decent to fantastic, the stupidity that runs rampant absolutely is. Characters suffer from the zombie flick stereotype of suddenly forgetting all common sense until it is absolutely crucial, survivors have to be taught the absolute basics of survival despite stating several times that they've seen zombie movies, they reference Train to Busan for gods sakes but don't know how to push a table against a door until a teacher arrives?It's also a shame that one of this shows greatest strengths also becomes its greatest weakness, as it's ability to jump between separate survivor groups is seamless and anticipated, it is also annoying at times and very much unnecessary. Without going into detail there are entire character arcs pushed in to the already overcrowded narrative who don't contribute to the story and serve no purpose to anything other than a small emotional hit to the viewer. That's all. Unnecessary and very annoying to watch. It also must be said that the animation, a thankfully minor part of the mostly prop/makeup based effects, is laughably bad. Luckily it is only used sparingly.Overall, however, I am thrilled at the end results and despite the aforementioned issues, I can't wait to bite into more. Hopefully season 2 will be just as frantic and exciting!\",\n",
       "   'There is a LOT of drama in this show which at times was a little bit hard to believe because there\\'s an actual zombie apocalypse happening and these high school kids are still worrying about \"who likes who\" and throwing temper tantrums and the protagonist girl giving the cold shoulder to the protagonist guy who has a major crush on her.I also really didn\\'t like how it seemed like the most important person to save during the entire show was On-jo. So many people sacrificed their lives for her and yet she was being so selfish throughout the entire show.But I was willing to look past all of that, as long as they were going to let my man Cheong-san get the girl in the end. But NOPE! They made Cheong-san a simp for On-jo the entire show and then the second she finally starts treating him right, they kill him off.I don\\'t know if this is typical in K-dramas but they made a lot of the guys weak, timid, bumbling buffoons. There was A LOT of female-on-male violence which was more than annoying and the males were always scared of the females and just took their beatings like wimps.There were significantly more female students alive at the end than males, so it promotes the idea that males are expendable and should sacrifice themselves for the females, but also that the females were smarter and better survivors.I\\'m also mad about them killing off some of the best characters. Like for example they killed off the scientist who created the virus pretty early when he could have played a bigger role in the show. On-jo\\'s dad spent the entire show trying to find her, he finally finds her and then gets bit within 2 seconds of finding her.The episodes are long (around 1hr each) and there is 12 of them so it starts to get a bit exhausting with all the drama but the ending was okay because they left it open for a sequel season but at the end of the day.I enjoyed the show at times and was annoyed at other times so that\\'s why it gets a 5/10. If they let my man Cheong-san live and get the girl in the end it would\\'ve been a 7/10 but they did him dirty. Lived and died a simp. Shameful.',\n",
       "   'After watching it, we can be sure there won\\'t be any season 2. Cause they finished it beautifully. But still hoping for another season. You should also watch the lead actress\\'s (Ji-hu)\\'s great masterpiece \"House of Hummingbird\"',\n",
       "   'There are many zombie movies already for us. But it is simply superb....👌wonderful acting.. not a slow start at all....must give a try for to this fabulous series... And it gonna be a best series like sucide squad....',\n",
       "   \"This series just feels so real, and everything happened in it can be convincingly happening in real life, this is what most zombie series are lack of. And another thing this series is good at is the action scenes, they really did a great job.All characters in this drama is depicted well, with their distinct personalities, even those characters that only appeared once or twice. The main characters also got distinct personalities and each of the acted very well, that's what we need for a zombie drama, because a zombie drama without deep character development can be pure brainless entertainment with lot's of gore and violence only.There're also shortcomings in this series, especially in mid sections of this drama, everything gets a little boring, however, the plot is getting more and more attractive as the plot goes on, and it can still hook audiences without much action scenes involved.Overall, this series is a great zombie series with great action scenes, and a decent plot with deep character development, it's a zombie series with good production value.\",\n",
       "   \"It's definitely one of the better zombie flicks. The acting is great, the story is good. I would have given it a 7 or 8 if it weren't for two very annoying things, that I couldn't get past:1. They had literally nothing to eat or drink for what seemed more than two days, while half the time running, fighting zombies, climbing up and down buildings, and parkouring. Non of them seemed pretty fazed about that and apart from a few comments, the lack of vital sustenance in a zombie apocalypse, was considered pretty much like an insignificant detail, rather than the difference between life and death.2. Decision making and reactions were at points absurdity itself. Someone is bitten, turning, and will kill us all - let's stare and see what will happen - that, on more than one occasion. Zombies are attacking my friends - let me stare for a while and then hit them with a book. We have to make other split second decisions - again let's stare. There's a lot of staring going on.Overall, however it's a good movie if you get past this and some other annoying details.\",\n",
       "   \"Watch it now would do anything to be able to watch it for the first time again i feel empty whenever i'm not watching this but i feel like the shouldn't of killed off cheong su.

       "   \"Not your usual train to Busan spread over 540minutes Zombie fiesta. You'll be disappointed.The starting looks promising, like most Korean shows. It escalated once the kidnapped student got her first bite. From then on, hell broke loose and quick. But I don't buy the story of this outbreak not reaching outside the city given the modern instant tech we have now. You'll telling me thousands of student though surrendered their phones for class and not one of them has a stealth phone somewhere??How the capital, Seoul and their white house and no international coverage was mentioned for outbreak of this scale is beyond me.Plot holes are too constant as show progress. The main cast of students all live like cat's life, outwitting speedy zombies throughout the show without a scratch hardly, with sometimes 1V1 fend off. Bear in mind these students hadn't had a meal or sip of water for days yet their adrenalin never seems to wear off.The Shakespearian little romances between some of them are putting me off so much that I fast forward to the action most of the time. Who has the time to confess to their crush when you not eat drink or poop in days, stinky all over with cracking lips?!Director could have spare us the melodrama and trim this down to 8 eps of pure adrenaline pumping thriller.Visual is good don't get me wrong. The acting skills of all the walking and running zombies deserves a shout out, more than the humans, yea and the director's.Now many aspects of the show barely fit much of the logic, which plays a huge part to a serious film watcher like me.Why would Einstein the scientist ask the detective to retrieve his laptop for the remedy? When eventually, he mentioned there was none and only way is to wipe out, disintegrate the bodies. HELLO? Michael Owen moment there...Who decides how long the bitten will turn into zombies?? We saw 3 seconds, 3 minutes, 3 weeks (Genius girl) . Are they generically decided? Or environmentally?? Or to the director's mood??And who decides who turns into a super zombie?? (Die hard cyclone, genius girl, bullied girl etc) they virtually have nothing in common! Intelligence or physicality wise. Pretty far fetched by now the story.And what do the zombies hunting based on? The sound as they put it? Visuals? Smells? If it's sound they would have pound on anyone moving even fellow zombians ain't it? If it's visual they would pound on the super zombies as they still walk and look like humans. If it's smell (they bypass super humans) they wouldn't have to depend on sounds then! Directors discretion again I guess.Die hard cyclone was so annoying at first as he die hard.... But I kinda rooted for him in later stages as those students were a pain to watch by now with their forgettable escaping ideas. I just wise cyclone killed them all.And if genius girl aka Seline underworld had the power all along after turning into super zombie why can't she put herself in the front for most escapades?? She's strong as hell as seem in final stages (neck breakers so on) what a waste!It's a shame I would have like to have see bullied girl super zombie take on cyclone for a kill bill showdown! They didn't mentioned her whereabouts when the series ended. What a bummer. Not some Seline underworld flew away to the covenant OMG.Since the story was half wrecked by now, I may as well see a super zombie lover boy1 take on Cyclone! But that was not to be as well...What a letdownHere's the likeable;\\nLiam Neelson adventure to save her daughter was heart warming to see until the absurd tennis court get to the chopper moment. Okay before that, why he opened the hall door to see her daughter?? It could be dozens of zombies with all those hard banging! Directors answer this please.The detective or his sidekick actually. A humorous acting better than most of other characters. Brings a laugh whenever his seemingly cowardice character came back to help out!The little girl, saved by Ripley. What a performance and a tear jerker in the restaurant of her enduring the lost of the mother, now a walking dead.The Archery sis, aka Katniss Everdeen the only coolest human character I like in the show. Wish the show revolves around her slaying the dead instead of the many Shakespearian plays we had to put up with.All in all, if your in for entertaining purposes then this will probably work for you.For serious film watchers like me all the little nonsensical is a deciding factor on the overview.Season 2? Bring back die hard cyclone instead of loverboy1 please. And bullied girl super zombie has yet to unleash her potential. Make use of that.\",\n",

So yeah, DO WATCH IT TOO, i loved it!\",\n",

If your characters exist only to take stupid decisions so that you can create manufacturered drama instead of organic ones, you failed as a writer.May be some like that, but i personally hate this show.\"],\n",

       " '지옥': [[\"A Korean miniseries that offers a bit of everything for the viewer. It's a little choppy at times and essentially feels like two three-episode series stitched together, and at times it's rushed or too slow. But I enjoyed the religious-themed plotting and the way it's used to shine a light on various aspects of human behaviour. The CGI isn't great but the show is high on drama and I can forgive the occasional misstep for the exciting set-pieces it has to offer. It's not SWEET HOME, but it's better than average.\",\n",
       "   'I sat down to watch the 2021 South Korean TV series titled \"Hellbound\" (aka \"Jiok\"), partly because I saw the trailer on Netflix and also because I was told that it was from the guy that made \"Train to Busan\". So I was gearing up for something spectacular, especially since the trailer was interesting.And I made it two episodes into the ordeal and then I just gave up. Wow, talk about a swing and a miss. The storyline told in \"Hellbound\" was just laughably poorly written and had nothing that appealed to me, to be bluntly honest. So this was a major disappointment.The storyline told in \"Hellbound\" was just downright boring, especially because nothing particularly interesting happens as you suffer through nearly 50 minutes of excruciating boredom with each episode. And it didn\\'t help one bit that the character gallery in \"Hellbound\" was generic, flat, boring and had the appeal of watching paint drying on a wall.Now, I am sure that the concept might have seemed interesting when the creators were penning it out on paper. But the transition from idea and paper to the screen was just bland and anti-climatic.Visually then \"Hellbound\" was actually okay. But special effects can only do so little when there is nothing in terms of contents for a storyline or interesting characters.My rating of \"Hellbound\" lands on a generous three out of ten stars. And this is not something I will be returning to watch the rest of, since it totally fell short of providing me with anything worthwhile in terms of entertainment or enjoyment. Usually South Korea puts out fairly good movies and TV series, but of course it is utopia to think that everything that comes from South Korea is going to be gold, and \"Hellbound\" certainly was not gold.',\n",
       "   'Korean Drama \"Hellbound\" is an atmospheric drama with a dark story and masterful direction.The drama has an interesting story to offer. Exploring the nature of men when an unexpected new element appears, changing the way we lived so far and spreading fear. Fear that is the common factor that everyone uses in order to achieve their goals. And the ending was masterfully handled as well, with a huge cliffhanger to prepare the audience for what is to come next.However, and apart from those, the drama felt hectic and partial. The pace was all over the place, with events following one another in a way that wasn\\'t either smooth nor served the drama well. In addition, the drama was disjointed, as its parts didn\\'t blend in together nor followed each other nicely.Finally, the CGI were not great, but the performances were masterful by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 5 out of 10.',\n",
       "   \"As daemons manifest on the streets of Korea, torturing and then incinerating their hell-bound victims, a brutal new religious hierarchy arises. Intentionally or otherwise, 'Hellbound' is a scathing attack on religion. In the face of horrific and inexplicable events, people desperate for answers turn to those who claim to hold a monopoly on truth, who take it upon themselves to rule in the name of the divine, who set the rules that define goodness and sin, and who quickly turn to coercion and force to supress alternate ideas and maintain their exalted position. The classic theological paradox manifests (reconciling divine love with infant damnation) and the fate of non-believers is traditional: immolation. I watched an English-subtitled version on Netflix, so can't really comment on the acting or the original script but I thought the series was excellent. The special effects are a bit weak at times but the plot is fast moving and compelling. The film has a bit of a scale problem, coming across as a bit of an isolated fable with little mention of the world outside of Korea or the response to the events from other religions, otherwise it's outstanding. Fans of Philip Pullman and Dawkinistas should especially enjoy the show's bloody spiritual excesses.\",\n",
       "   'To put it shortly, Hellbound is an interesting mumbo jumbo series, well-acted with a very good flow, some outstanding VFX, beefy \"things\" that would have been better depicted and shown as skinny witch-like creatures, some total nonsense along the way, messages that every viewer would decipher and analyze at his own pace and on his own belief.It is gripping with a compelling flow and finishes on a super high mysterious note that just shatters all viewers\\' built-up belief momentum up to that point and starts constructing a new brazen wall with unlikely bricks.',\n",
       "   \"Panic on the streets of Seoul, as three demons seek to harvest sinners souls, if you're one of the selected, there's no chance to be neglected, as a god has got you under his control - with the usual misguided disciples to help.If this doesn't get you thinking of your own mortality and the extents that false prophets, and those that feel they have more legitimacy, try to corrupt and misguide, then I'm not sure what will. Powerful and thoughtful stuff.\",\n",

So if you want to watch people talk and they talk about a story that is absolutely idiotic here you go. I read this is from the creators of train to busan, I really hope that's not true because train is an absolute BRILLIANT film this isnt even close to a bad high school documentary series.\",\n",
       "   'Hellnound: Korean horror series. Monsters/Demons appear chase sinners, rend them asunder and then reduce their remains to burnt bones and ashes. This is preceded by visitations by \"angels\" who tell the damned of the time and date of their death. A Cult leader claims that these deaths are god\\'s judgement and the dead are sent to Hell. A Social Media influencer, Arrowhead, seeks out those who have been condemned to out them and also calls on his followers to attack wrongdoers. A condemned woman decides to allow her death to be live-streamed. The Arrowheads savagely attack the police, lawyers, anyone who aids the damned. Rather disturbing, especially the sociopathic Cult leader, Jung Jinsu, laughing at the idea that the police would investigate the will of god. The scenes portraying the relentless attacks by the Demons as they pursue, attack and tear their victims to pieces are really top notch horror. Mixed in with this is the tale of a detective, Kyunghu,n investigating the deaths and how Jung Jinsu involves Kyunghun\\'s daughter in the cult\\'s activities. Good and gruesome. Directed by Yeon Sang-ho (Train To Busan), written by Choi Kyu-sok. On Netflix. 8/10.',\n",

       "   \"Death Note but Light Yagami is actually Kami and he sends Shinigami to execute the victims.A new Korean horror added to Netflix. I came in knowing minimal about the premise and didn't watch any trailer videos. You should too, because the first 6 minutes of the series gave you an exact taste of what the show is about. Only 6 minutes and it would definitely hook you in, especially if you like horror.The first three episodes was what I call perfection. Since the show has only 6 episodes, it did not waste any time. Even though there's not a whole lot of time for character development, the pacing was incredible. The intensity was through the roof, and I was transfixed to the screen in terror of the inevitability that some characters would face.The last three episodes was where the problem with the show arose. The transition from episode 3 to 4 wasn't smooth because the pacing took a pretty big deceleration. It took some buildup and then the last episode became amazing and rewarding, similar to the first three episodes.Also, this show almost had no chill. It was very violent almost to the point of violence for shock value. Unfortunately there were scenes where people getting beat up that would be very uncomfortable for viewers. However, the portrayal of how cult or religious leaders could bend the meaning of an event or text and manipulate the mind of a large group of people justified the shocking violence of the series. The story worked this theme very well and hooked me in even more.Overall, an incredible and intense horror series that does not pull any punches. For sure for sure check it out. 9.5/10.\",\n",
       "   '\"Upholding righteousness and justice in fear of damnation. Is that truly righteous and just?\"Right off the bat, I must clear up some obvious misunderstandings! This isn\\'t one of those typical Fantasy/Sci-fi/Supernatural shows that deal with Monsters or otherworldly creatures; as opposed to what Netflix might have suggested through their various promotional content on numerous social media platforms lately.This show goes way deeper in scrutinizing not one but many societal demeanours and it is indeed way more philosophic than you guys might have ever imagined!On top of having a powerful statement heeding Religious beliefs, faith, cults etc; Hellbound seemingly speaks against the core idea of Extremism, Radicalism too. The show with much profundity contemplates and argues the very foundation of this dangerous, self-destructive stuff, that can only give rise to chaos and social unrest in society.However, the exact representation here isn\\'t as simple as it may sound. Believe it or not, It has got multifaceted layers of complicated matters and countless subtexts which can only be found out only if you pay good enough attention.Speaking of attention, the terrific writing willingly takes on the mantle and manages to withhold the all-important momentum and that too in a quite sophisticated manner! On the other side, you will get to know an array of versatile characters and each one of them\\'s individualistic narratives that feel so relatable on so many levels!Let us all just appreciate the whole ensemble, the entire cast; who had shown tremendous commitment and sincerity to each of their respective roles! And kudos to the technical team (Especially, the guys who were in charge of the Background Score); for giving it justice from a technological stance as well.My main criticisms lie in its core storyline, which at times, reveals glaring loopholes and is yet to provide transparency in regards to a few of the questions that sprung to my mind. Even though, it was expected that the story would take more than one season to come to a feasible conclusion; got to admit, I was expecting to get at least some kind of closure.',\n",

Not all of them works but when they do it really hooks you in.It's a short series and that's good because there's a lot of explanation and heavy thinking time. For the magnitude to sink in. Either you (can comes to terms with yourself) live by a belief or not. Does life have a meaning? The show seemingly asks .And I like it. There is no comic relief but rather borderline jittery over zealous high with the Arrowheads. And New Truth, what a name for the religion, as whoever grab on to the headline in social media controls the conversation.At first everything is neat and tidy. Until the first prophet died. Then the baby dilemma throws a wrench to really complicates things. Of course the central question is waiting for us in season 2(maybe 3). What are those creatures and where do they come from?

It reminds me a lot of \"Death Note\" if you\\'ve ever watched that series but the idea of divine punishment for sinners and how it\\'s received by the world is a lot different in this series or course. There isn\\'t any explanation for the phenomena the people are experiencing...only that they must have done something to deserve their fates. The series drags you through 6 episodes (so far) that get more bleak and depressing as they carry on and then the series ends on a wtf moment. Hellbound is just not a satisfying experience to watch. There really are no redeeming characters and everyone seems to make deliberate bad decisions for the sake of plot progression.On a side note... Korean movies are also funny sometimes because only the police have guns so a majority of the \"violence\" involves groups of people or a person hitting someone with a bat or club. There is a lot of that in this movie and after a while those scenes get tiring to watch because it\\'s almost like the people they\\'re beating are made of rubber or something. After getting beaten nearly fatally by pipes and bats they just get up and start running like nothing happened. Not just in this series but in just about every Korean movie or series.

Unfortunately after episode 3 the show grew boring, and it was just the same thing over and over again. The show ended with an interesting twist, I wish they had put that twist in episode 4 and used it to flesh out the rest of the show. Unfortunately this show turned out to be a violent, chaotic mess with no real reasoning or answers provided. I think a season 2 is highly unlikely, so as an audience we will probably never receive answers, which is annoying and disappointing. I would definitely pass on this one.',\n",

Another nonsense that the guy beat at manignoring his job, while the cop also ignored his duty and arrest that man.

But actually the focus is on humans and their lust for power and what dogmatic thinking and power structures will do to a society.Yes there are these creatures that will kill humans in pretty horrific ways after they receive their death messages. Still this in the first season is more of a side aspect as there are groups and characters that try to use it to drive their own agendas.This is also proven by the way people speak. The death messages the victims receive are called \"decrees\" and the killing by these creatures is always named as \"demonstration\" (of god\\'s will).Fact of the matter is though that throughout the episodes there are a lot of unanswered questions and new questions always pop up - especially at the end of episode 6.The first season is actually split into two sections (episode 1-3 and 4-6) where you can say that both sections are basically a movie on their own. Between both \"movies\" there is also a shift in terms of main characters. Episodes 1-3 have different leads compared to episodes 4-6 and some characters from the first part only play a secondary role in the later episodes.I heard some people complain that the acting is bad but I disagree. The acting is actually pretty good overall. But I\\'ve been watching the show in Korean with English subtitles. So I\\'m hearing the original actors voices and from what I can tell they are doing a very good job.With some of the things happening in the story I\\'ve been thinking whether or not the writers wanted to draw some parallels to what has been happening with Covid and the vaccines (\"be a good citizen and get the shot or you may get god\\'s punishment ==> covid\").

       "   \"Netflix is back with another Korean web series as Hellbound started streaming barely a week back. The success of Squid Game must have prompted the makers to go online with the product which mostly appears to be hastily made, hurriedly edited, and forcefully given the final look without even thinking of a fitting finale. Maybe that is the reason they halted in the midway and paved the way for a sequel series as they did not have a proper plan on where to take the story.Even though the show has enough pace to sustain for six long episodes, the logic behind making such a show is barely understood. Has Netflix gone mad after minting money with Squid Game, that it forgot to even review what they are showing? Even they did not bother to lip-sync the English dubbed version and in most of the scenes, the quality of dubbing resembles those dubbed movies back in the '80s.Character portrayal is ludicrous, camera works half-hearted, editing poor and acting over the top. This is in a nutshell, the review of this odd show. In the scenes where the Arrowhead YouTuber appears, you feel like damning yourself against the TV screen. The principles of The New Truth Society are watery thin and those are annoyingly self-contradictory. The horror value is so imbecile that you may recall those cheap, poorly made zombie movies made when you were a toddler. Even they did not hesitate to hire the VIP scene from the Squid Game, so low they stooped to in the rush of making a web series just for the sake of keeping the Squid Game hype alive. Normally this type of show thrives on the CGI values which keep you glued to the screen. Unfortunately, Hellbound comes with the weakest CGI I have watched in recent times on Netflix.Avoid this nonsense joke. Spend your hard-earned time on something more meaningful on Netflix. And do not go by the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. IMDB this time is closer to the truth.My Review- 4 out of 10Available on- Netflix.\",\n",
       "   'This is really good. SK is knocking it out of the park on Netflix.

Regardless, Definitely recommend...excellent cult/supernatural drama.',\n",
       "   'The premise is brilliant but the story was dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. It is hard to believe no police force or political leader dared to challenge Fascist gangs led by a Youtube personality in blacklight makeup. Koreans are apparently made of stone and are immune to massive head trauma.I wish it better explored backstories of people burned alive by interdimensional beings. Also, does no other country in the world exist to react to these happenings?Entertaining, but not as nuanced as Snowpiercer or Squid Game for social commentary.',\n",
       "   'Hellbound is a dragged-about-through-the-muck, lackluster attempt at horror. While it is, at times, gory (a little too gory, really) it especially drags between the scenes in which poor souls are dragged about by those oversized, grey gorillas.None of what happens has any meaning. Whether that\\'s classified as existential or nihilistic, either way it\\'s always bleak in an unfulfilling way.My family bought into the reviews claiming the naysayers don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about. But alas, the naysayers got it right. Korea does put out more consistently good quality entertainment than Hollywood, but they spit out some duds as well. Nobody can escape it entirely.HB is watchable, but our opinion is that it\\'s not worth the time nor the effort. This is not Squid Game, in which there\\'s shocking violence, with some blood and the like, but no gross-out gore. Squid Game, furthermore, has no gratuitous violence: It all reinforces the horror that society creates when it\\'s \"Every man for himself.\" Kingdom is another horror offering out of Korea that\\'s done exceptionally well, with nothing feeling out of place.HB seems to have nothing in place. The plot twists don\\'t pack enough of a wallop. The plot pivot at the halfway mark is strange, with neither half of the show being wrapped up completely. There are some likable characters, but they drift away, rather than find any permanent resting place.HB\\'s worst sin is that it\\'s boring. It did not hold the interest of anybody in my family, and we\\'re Kdrama fans. We stuck with it, as that\\'s our habit, and we also kept hoping something would pull it all together. Abandon hope. Nothing gets pulled together. It could actually be by design, in order to underscore a nihilist theme. By saying that there is design is as generous as I can be. It\\'s entirely possible that there\\'s none. It\\'s difficult to tell.Having said all the above, HB is still superior to most of Hollywood\\'s horror offerings which depress the IQ, and heighten sadistic indifference in the viewer. HB absolutely will not do that: Your IQ is safe from being dragged down by it, and your sense of empathy will not be preyed upon by it. HB has some truly good elements that were left unreconciled in a string of missed opportunities. That\\'s what fans of the show have likely connected with.As a piece of horror, HB\\'s around a 7/10, but in entertainment value alone, it\\'s in the neighborhood of 5.5 - 5.9, and definitely under a 6. My son was emphatic about that.Unfortunately for HB, after being starved of quality entertainment for too long, Kdramas shocked our systems with quality overload. Now our standards have shot up heavenward.If blood&guts is your jam, HB is gory. In fact, it\\'s uncomfortably so. There\\'s only a half dozen or so such scenes, however, none of the deaths are quick, and all of them are tortuous.We are new enough to K-entertainment that we haven\\'t seen many horror pieces. As previously mentioned, Kingdom and Squid Game are far superior to HB. Tunnel is a cop show involving a serial killer, so it isn\\'t far from horror, and Tunnel is excellent. Black is another police/fantasy drama that is quite close to horror. It\\'s depicted on screen, but even more so, there\\'s horror of the mind. Black is a profound work with no wasted dialogue: Almost every line connects to another element in the show, building a complex work of art. If you aren\\'t sure what to watch next, those should not disappoint.HB is a big letdown -pun intended. Repent, turn back, and save yourself from the mediocre forces that will definitely drag your evening down, if you give in to them.Quote:~It seems that none of us have the right to make decisions for ourselves.~IMHO...\\n🎬7 🤔5 ⚡8 🎭7\\nSuggested Age 16& up.',\n",

Hellbound is in a whole different league. It is more of a proper horror series. It does have a fairly straightforward storyline, just throw in a handful of hellish monsters, a manipulative internet cult (aren't they all?), and some death premonitions. There are some truly horrific and gory scenes scattered throughout the series, but I think what I most enjoyed, was the gritty realism.

It's very slow and meandering at times, there was an action scene where they won the shaky cam award of the year, some characters just vanish after the time jump with no explanation, but it did it's job of keeping me watching.Hopefully there will be a second season as it does end on a very interesting cliffhanger.Recommended as long as you have a good attention span.\",\n",

Its quite astounding the investment in money, time and space in their thoughts that people give over to something that technically isn't provable. Christianity etc. This show looks at what happens if events in the modern age were to occur, supernatural/relgious and with the wide use of photography and video, how would the world react. Should people with proof via video and proof from their own eyes simply bow down to new religious orders that pop up? Or should they ignore their doctrines and stand against any religion or supernatural entities judgement on their lives? This questions asks a lot of interesting hypotheticals and plays with them in an amazing fashion. Not to give much away of the plot, apart from saying that 3 creatures start coming into the world and bringing death upon apparent sinners who have been warned of their death prior to it occuring via the prophecies of supposed angels. It stirs up amazing questions of free will, the god question, separation of church and state and how the media should be neutral to hardline religious values and doctrineThe show has a great pace over 6 episodes and it feels longer than it was, but in a good sense as nothing felt rushed and there were excellent payoffs.

I didn't know neither the comic nor the show, and it didn't seem like what I'd usually read on the platform.I gave the show a try, and it made me curious about the comic.The comic is way darker than the show so far, but the show is not as bad as what some reviews suggest. Yes, the execution might seem a bit flat and slow at times, but it also depends whether you watch the show in Korean with subtitles, or dubbed. The Korean version is much better. They also have many characters to introduce in just a few episodes, so the storyline might lack speed in the first two episodes.The story is about us, humans, paying for our sins, and mystical creatures descending on Earth to make us atone for our sins. It criticizes the inefficiency of our judicial systems, and whether humans can truly just other humans for their crimes and sins. It makes me wonder whether all sins should be judged the same: to be sentenced to Hell, as the story may suggest.Watch out for the acting of who plays Jeong Jin-soo, that I find terrifying. 😱 He seems to be able to show such a twisted mind. Who is the real evil?One giant miss: the creatures (grim reapers?) seem to have a much more twisted and sadistic personality in the comic.\",\n",

That sort of makes perfect sense when you think of how things have been going, it\\'s a \"yeah that might as well happen.\"But to be serious, we have an intriguing plot \"things appear, say people are going to hell, other things appear and burn them to death.\" and a single incident ensues that sends the world into a tailspin of nightmarish overreaching religious zealotry where people will throw their own families to the dogs just because they \"think\" they are \"sinners\".It\\'s an excellent premise and it\\'s what kept me hooked for the full run.BUT.Oh lord did this series go all over the place, from the first set of episodes where everything is set up, from Jin Kyung-hun trying to solve the case to his eventual fall and defeat to watch as Jung Jin-su is killed so he can save his daughter.Or the secondary plot where it\\'s jumped forwards 5 years and it\\'s now about a newborn baby about to be killed and the world is under the control of the New Truth.Or the side plot about Min Hye-jin at first being a lawyer (with apparent unlimited resources) that somehow survives a brutal gangland beating to become an underground leader of a subversive army that works against the New Truth to hide the deaths.This story could\\'ve been done better being stretched out, season 1\\'s 6 episode run for the build up of the reveal that Jung Jin-su is just another victim and is clinically insane but has built a cult around that insanity.Leading into season 2 where everything\\'s gone to heck and a handbasket and everything is worse, leading to the reveal stinger for a season 3.Add to this quickly boiled over plot that doesn\\'t give the viewer time to breathe and add the all over there plots that either don\\'t go anywhere or are useless to the narrative.This failed terribly to do a decent job.Is it a good series? No, not really, I didn\\'t find myself enjoying anything, the dub is - as always - horrendous, the story makes zero sense in context, Jung Jin-su was the first ever chosen for this, and it was 20 years?

It paints an unflattering picture how ideologies and organised religions rise to power, but also does not scrimp on action (mostly brutal and disturbing). People complaining about the slow pacing probably just wanted to see a horror flick about monsters. Hellbound is more than that, and the pacing is just right: enough to tell the story, but not long enough to bore the viewer.The acting is great as expected, and the way the story is broken in two arcs, also works very well.

Then you have the arrowhead punk members who believe the demons go after sinners so they, uh, beat and kill people? Yeah, logic is also not this show\\'s strong suite.

In fact, it was gratuitous, because if people know these creatures are coming, why don\\'t they take heroin or some drug that makes them immune to pain? Because these creatures don\\'t just send you to hell; they torture you first. But any human would quickly get knocked out by one punch, but instead, it shows them screaming until the very end.

They beat to death this old lady, only because she was with a lawyer woman whom was simply trying to do her job to protect some person (she never prevented the hell monsters). So they just go after the cop, too, and end up kicking him, like they\\'re full of hate. WHY?? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

This happens so often, esp. In the 2nd and 3rd episode, I shut it off. I mean what\\'s the point?Besides this, the show was boring and missed opportunities. For example, the woman with 2 kids who was sent to hell--we never found out what her sins were! She\\'s just a working mom, so I was hoping the show would question our perceptions and show us how evil she was. But nobody figures out anything, yet the Arrowhead group are so convinced that she MUST have been an evil sinner regardless! The daughter of the cop gets roped in by the charm of the Arrowhead leader (the \"chairman\"), but then he convinces her to find and then jointly KILL the suspect in her mother\\'s murder? I was hoping they would show us that the old drunk man was innocent, but again, that plot point went nowhere. They just incinerate his body, and dump him into some field, I guess, as propaganda (why would they need it??). And why would she so willingly go along with murder? Stupid.Finally, we are to believe that a local police department is supposed to deal with these astounding incidents of hell monsters (on video!) beating and burning to death citizens? The feds never get involved? Just a local\\npolice precinct? And those in that precinct are targeted and beaten up by the \"believers\"? The show thinks we are IDIOTS.This show is no Squid Game, that\\'s for sure.',\n",
       "   \"It's an overhyped series.1. It makes no sense. We've no idea what these monsters are or why they send people to hell until the very end.It's implied that many of the hellbound people didn't commit major SINS. What exactly are SINS in this context? Why are these poor people being thrashed & tortured? Even if they return at the end, the fact that they suffered greatly remains. So it's clear that the supernatural force at work here isn't righteous.2. People keep saying that this isn't about monsters at all, but about society & human nature. I'm sorry, are we supposed to be astounded by the discovery that humans can be terrible? WE ARE ALREADY AWARE. This has been seen in everyday situations. The only new concept here is these massive yeti monsters. So don't tell me it's not about monsters transporting people to hell when the show is literally titled HELLBOUND & it's very much about the freaking monsters.3. It's heartbreaking & upsetting. When I say this, I don't mean that I can't deal with sadness. SQUID GAME had some heartbreaking scenes. TRAIN TO BUSAN did as well. Those two were absolute masterpieces. Hellbound shouldn't be compared to them at all. I'm surprised at how many people say this is superior to SQUID GAME. In my opinion, No, it doesn't. I feel mentally exhausted after watching this series.4. Now, let's talk about the last episode. How exactly did the baby manage to survive? I was relieved that it was still alive, but come on. These monsters have huge rods for claws & a variety of contraptions ready to attack humans. You're saying that these ruthless monsters couldn't tear apart two fragile tiny people? What a farce.Overall, I've seen some bad shows, but this is one of the very few that I regret watching. I believe it has passed its redeeming value, & they will no longer be able to adequately explain it. But I'd be delighted to be proven wrong. Was it frightening? Yes, & it's upsetting. What's scarier is that it has a perfect rating on Rotten Tomatoes.I'm done. I just had to say all this.\",\n",

       "   \"Despite some weak points, this show addresses many social, political, religious, media and moral issues quite brilliantly.The most obvious one is the religious theme - angels, demons, god, hell, etc. I thought some of the terminologies and concepts could be more abstract, otherwise it's too close to some of the existing religions, as a result, it may confine people to think about issues such as existentialism and morality through the lens of this or that religion, instead of thinking about them in a more open manner. The show is also a study on the frequently recurring contradictions between what people believe they're supposed to do and their ultimate deeds.I'm surprised few reviewers - even professional ones - mention references to the dictators in North Korea. Some nods to dictators - such as the giant murals in the New Truth building - are painfully obvious. Dictators and cult leaders are kind of two sides of the same coin, they bend the narrative, manipulate the public viewpoints, and filter what gets out to people. The show also reflects how some of the dictators could be immensely flawed - to say the least - and sometimes even dumb, yet they still have numerous followers, many of whom are intelligent, at their command. Human psychology is fascinating.Another interesting aspect of the show is about determinism and punishment. We often think we have free will, but how often do we have control over what happens to us, what we're thinking, and how much our actions will influence what will unfold. And if we don't have control over such matters, do we have free will? And who and how should someone gets be punished? Who gets to be the judge?The Arrowheads and social media are obvious reflections of our contemporary issues - addiction to screens, fake news, overconsumption, etc. I thought much more context could be given to the Arrowhead hooligans - how did they get to be so radicalized? It's an opportunity to draw ideas from extreme nationalist/supremacist/far-right ideologies. I'm not sure if it's a commentary on how our society has become passively complicit in crimes or just bad scriptwriting, but the scenes where bystanders are doing nothing when someone's trying to harm a baby or beating up an old man are, sad yes, but also inexplicably bizarre.It's my opinion that the artistic direction could be much less pedestrian, everything from when the snow falls, the soundtrack, how people interact with technology... could be much more imaginative. I know maybe they want the show to be rooted in realism, but when you already have CGI demons... you can veer away from exact carbon copy of our reality a little more.In short, Hellhound is one of the few mainstream shows that has the audacity to tackle many hard problems that plague our contemporary world head-on. However, I wish it would act more than just a mirror of our problems and present the underlying and often not-so-obvious causes. Also, alas, it suffers a little from overambition, there's only that much you can show in 6 episodes. Any one of the themes that they touch on can be the basis of a whole separate series. But it's perhaps great news for anyone with a short attention span - they can consume a maximum amount of materials within a minimum amount of time.\",\n",

Whether it's representative of South Korean film making or not I am in no position to say - however, those saying it's boring must have the attention span of a gnat.It was an interesting move splitting the story into two parts and overall I think it worked well.

The absence of anything good. Of love. No one can say for sure what it is really like, but we have an idea because it has been written throughout the ages. Nothing has waivered and all the prophecies of old have come true. We are told that we are not ones to judge others, unless we ourselves be judged first. To not cast a stone, unless we ourselves have never sinned. Christianity isn't about damning others. It's about loving others and forgiving. About true repentance of our own sins. Before acting like you know anything about Christianity and Theology, Apologetics, etc...Please try doing a little research. Please read St. Thomas Aquinas who is one of the worlds's greatest philosophers and theologians. He was wrestling with the simple minded new Atheist movement's dumb questions centuries ago.

Some characters are completely removed from the show without valid reasoning.You can tell the director used his same schtick from Train to Busan because no one does anything at all to protect themselves or to negatively impact the villain in anyway; simply just do the exact opposite of what a person with half a mind would do. In that case, it makes it hard to feel sympathy for these \"stupid supposed protagonists\".By episode four it turns into a religious nut job overly zealous overly righteous freak show and loses anything of value. Whatever of the story is left gets completely tossed aside as these freaks seemingly, and without resistance from anyone or anything existing, take control over everything, to the point their beliefs go exactly opposite of what the story is trying to portray.Nothing is explained, nothing is solved, nothing really happens at all that\\'s beneficial to the series. The CGI is atrocious, including the baby, and for the amount of time they show the baby, the producers should be ashamed.This isn\\'t a horror series, it\\'s a philosophical series about humans either succumbing to or defying god\\'s will. The director/writer must have had a mid life crisis coming up with this one, and the final twist at the end doesn\\'t help in the slightest, or make it interesting, since nothing was explained at all over six episodes.',\n",

Those demons would NOT leave the child, as their only task is to take it. The parents being tied together would not stop them.I loved the uniqueness of the story and the take on the righteous - moreso the fact that there was randomness to those selected - so the human perception of hell was incorrect all along.Cinematography, like most South Korean shows, was first class.Reading the 'reviews' here - I need to state the following.1. CGI is bad. Then YOU go and create the CGI that YOU believe is acceptable.2. Story is bad. Then YOU become a screenwriter, get it funded, approved and make it workable in a series.3. Actors can't act. Then YOU become an actor and see what sort of range you have.So many people here must be exceptional in their own lives to pick apart content so easier and readily.

One thing's for sure, it is not comparable to Squid Game. Nor is it any better than Kingdom.I completed all 6 episodes in one sitting. The first 3 episodes were good and I can say for episodes 4 to 6, you'll only be watching it just for the sake of finishing the series. It gets a little slow, they could have cut some scenes out and probably the only motivation is to see whether the baby will eventually die or not. And that last scene in Episode 6 is a total WTF moment that will make you punch your hands because now you'll have to wait for a whole year for season 2 to hopefully know why everything is happening.Giving it an 8/10 because it did keep me engaged and curious. And it gave me something to reflect on personally regarding religion and the concept of heaven and hell in some other religions. Some people say that this show is mocking Christianity but I don't think so.Aside from that, I like how this show casted average looking people for most of the characters; even Yoo Ah In and Kim Hyun Joo looked like normal everyday people here, which is not typical of the usual Korean dramas where the main leads and supporting roles are super handsome or super beautiful or hot.

The plot conflicts in each episode felt way too repetitive in light of the fact that some of the series's questions were left unanswered in the end.

       "   'Main elements of the series:Radical Group Arrowhead = QAnon-like with hardcore following influencing/controlling people through their messages and brutality. Dongwook, a true nutjob, is the social media personality of the group that preaches about the wrath of god, sins and living a righteous life in YouTube-like broadcasts while encouraging violence. The group go hand in hand with The New Truth.The New Truth = Religious organization, cultish and authoritative controlling people through using God, fear, sins, and a divine intervention. Gained power claiming the supernatural creatures are supposedly sending sinful people to hell and only they have the right on how \"this phenomenon should be interpreted\". Nobody knows, at this point, where these creatures come from or what they truly mean - (agree with one reviewer that probably they represent society\\'s judgements rather than god\\'s).Social Media/Media/instant uploads = It is quickly and drastically changing the mindsets and actions of people and not for the better. Facts/logical thinking are no longer given enough importance.The real horror of the show is not the hulk-like figures gruesomely sending sinful people to hell and the mysterious cult-like figure who started it all but the aftermath. That\\'s why the last three episodes are different from the first three. I saw complaints about that but actually that was a smart move by the director because its not about continuing with stories of all the characters from first episodes but about showing a drastic change (from episode 4 on) that most people are now controlled and living in a completely different world after only few years. I think the director wanted to show how fast lives can change through fear, misjudgments and blind following as there are many opportunists out there that take advantage to gain power.Lastly, If you are looking for another Squid Game type show, this is not it. Nor it is right and quite ludicrous to compare the two!! Also, if you are looking for constant action, blood, gore, CGIs that impress you and easy answers maybe this is not for you either because it\\'s all about the subject matter that is multilayered and philosophical. My only complaint about this series is that some of the acting needs improving in case of a second season so it doesn\\'t come off as pretentious & over the top. As for the undeserving low ratings, especially the many 1-2 star ratings, who knows what\\'s the thinking/motivation behind them (besides the Squid Game effect) but in this case really ignore them and draw your own conclusion.P.

Definitely a short series on Netflix that I really liked. This show was dark, voilent and emotional at times. Not sure why people say it's not realistic but I think it's definitely realistic since I've myself seen people making terrible/dumb decisions for the their love of religion!I really thought that the script was well implemented except that the CGI could have been alot better!Again we cannot compare Koreans to Hollywood yet although I've seen better Korean shows/movies with better CGI.However, the acting was on point! Yoo Ah in - this man can do all kinda roles!Unsure what people were expecting but this to me was definitely a great watch and worth recommending to people. There are alot of answered questions.

So it's hard to take the scenes where they appear seriously. They probably tried to stay faithful to their original design but they should have thought of designing them differently given the CGI results.Also, it became a little too much when they showed that the creatures could bring back someone to life and beat them up if they ended their life before their execution date. I literally rolled my eyes.One thing that makes it hard for the show to really give you an immersive experience is that people really don't seem that amazed by this strange phenomenon. I mean sure, we see people screaming and running but after that, it seems like no big deal? The world would literally be going mad in real life.Also it doesn't make much sense for a group of people to be going around beating people up if they truly believe that they should live a super righteous life in order to be closer to God and be spared from those creatures.All in all, it's entertaining and I would still recommend to watch.

Having watched through the end of the season now, I\\'m happy it didn\\'t end there. I would not agree that it is boring or lengthy, that seems to me like quite the opposite of it, just sometimes the story-telling takes the form of Korean drama, I don\\'t mind that at all, but I do realize how that can seem boring to some viewers.I have no idea how well the translations to English (or my native language, German) are.

Also, some pretty great fight scenes in eps 4-6.The only thing I think people could have a problem with is the brutal and emotional violence scattered throughout every episode. It's quite intense and it might not be comfortable for everyone, so defiantly for a mature audience only.\",\n",

       "   \"I very much enjoy many Korean dramas and films; I have been watching them for well over a decade (also many Japanese and some Taiwanese selections, and started with now older HK films). Netflix somehow manages to select the worst (this is not their first poor choice) -- no doubt catering cynically to a faction of the US audience who have little cultural taste, no apparent appreciation for good character dramas or depth and variety in human-oriented stories, and who love hyperviolence (such as in recent video games and lots of US films that feature endless tedious action, violence, sometimes sex, and little compelling or meaningful plot). I won't waste too much time here. Made it through three episodes of this series (won't bother with the rest), and though I like the main actors/actresses (and have seen them in other shows), this show is one of the worst and most undeserving of praise that I have seen amid many, many good to excellent shows (series and films) from Korea. I can like simple entertainment such as Train to Busan, but not this nightmare. Sad choice, Netflix. You really could do much better, and you could use your choices to advertise numerous demonstrations of storytelling excellence that have driven Korean TV, cable, and film entertainment to its current heights of praise. This is not a watchable example (it is in fact nauseating on many levels and may even be insulting as a representation of typical K-Dramas); it ought to be trashed; and this is (again) why I do not subscribe to your service.

In terms of originality, it can be compared to \"The Wailing\"(2016) by Na Hong-jin, and the ending of the last eposode is reminiscent of \"Children of Men\"(2006) by Alfonso Cuarón.As a Korean director, Yeon Sang-ho is not yet at the level of masters like Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho.

Deep messages given as usual by Korean cinema.',\n",
       "   'Although it has been touted as \"dystopian\", I believe Hellbound is a amplified depiction of modern day Korean life, as seen from the perspective of the writer (and probably many of its citizens). The younger generations call Korea \"Hell Joseon\" because of the deep caste system which prevents many from advancing or achieving, where some of the wealthy look down harshly on the middle-class and poor, where things much of the world sees as nothing, many Koreans have been raised to see as \"flaws\"- from where you live, where you went to school, to what your parents do, to not having living parents... anything that can be used to put one down is used. Art imitates life, and the writer expounded on it.In this series, I believe the \"New Truth\" represents certain media outlets and corporations who distort truth, cover up, spread unverified rumors, and manipulate public opinion to their advantage. Godly living is clearly not their mission, so I\\'m not sure why so many people didn\\'t get that.The \"Arrowheads\" represent Korea\\'s toxic cancel culture. For years, individuals who live to bring down others have taken to the internet on seek and destroy missions as soon as some \"scandal\" breaks out. They often cite they are \"upholding the country\\'s conservative values\" as their excuse- while mercilessly harassing and bullying and threatening others into submission, even encouraging suicides. (The irony being that these behaviors are not valuable or conservative) The message here: Lies spread like a disease, words have the power to kill.The monsters are NOT sent by God; they represent peoples\\' unjustified judging of others; hence the fact that no one knew how the hellbound had \"sinned\" or how a nicu newborn was \"judged\" as a sinner. When the original leader killed the man who had murdered the girls mother, it served to confirm that the \"hellbound\" were just people who had been judged indiscriminately, something that happens daily in our world.The lawyer, Song So Hyun, represents the average citizen, taking on and fighting back against these evils. In Korean culture and others, a man who is sent to prison can also see his wife, children, and family persecuted for his crime. She not only seeks to expose the cult, but to protect families from that condemnation.I believe it speaks to several social, political, and religious ills that plague this country and the world at large. I think it makes a powerful statement, and one that most will only really understand if they understand where the writer was writing from. It could be possible that some reject, put down, and ridicule this piece because they see their own behaviors in one of these entities. This work is too thought provoking to be subjected to unjustified judgement.I however, am looking forward to the next installment.',\n",
       "   \"First of all, I would say to ignore the people who have given this show low ratings because this was never made for them. They probably watched it assuming it was one type of show, and it turned out to be a different show, and they are bitter about it. I don't like drama period pieces, but you don't see me going on the Bridgerton's page and giving it low ratings just because the show wasn't for me.I would highly recommend watching this show if you like animes like Death Note. It is quite different from Death Note, but does have the same flavor in the whole supernatural judgement against sinners thing. Overall, the show was fast paced and intriguing enough for me to be hooked. They had nice cliff hangers at the end of the episodes which made you want to watch the next episode right away. I do think the first 3 episodes were better than the last 3 episodes because the pacing was faster in the first 3 episodes. The CGI for the monsters wasn't the greatest. It was good enough, and frankly wasn't the main focus of the show. The monster scenes were merely catalysts for the rest of the show's plot. That being said, I do believe they will dive deeper into the supernatural phenomenon and the monsters' origins if they come out with a 2nd season.The show wasn't perfect. I thought the characters did stupid things sometimes that made no sense. There was a vigilante group that would go around kidnapping and beating people up in name of God, made of mostly young kids. The fact they could do that with the police almost never catching them was quite ludicrous, especially since these were low level thugs, not smart enough to hide or escape effectively. And it was just plain stupid that the good guys who were opposing the bad guys did the bare minimum to protect themselves or fight back. I mean these vigilantes were beating people with bats and pipes; maybe get some weapons of your own to fight back? Or gather with a group of like-minded people who may have been victims of the vigilantes before and band together to fight back? Just felt the good guys were portrayed as lame ducks and let the bad guys just wail on them, barely fighting back.If you like drama stories with supernatural elements, then watch this show. If you are looking for a straight horror show, then this is not that show. I love horror shows, but this is not a straight horror show. The supernatural element is only there to push the drama along.\",\n",

       "   'WHAT I LIKED:\\nPretty much everything. Despite the fantastical nature of events depicted in the show, one can easily draw a parallel between those events and reality. Pretty much every authoritarian system out there, which includes religion and the current environment of shoving everything down your throat for \"your safety\" because \"they\" know better, is succinctly and brutally demonstrated in the show. To me, the show is about death and the randomness of it, and how certain despicable opportunists have taken advantage of that phenomenon and contorted it to suit their mythical narrative and amass untold influence and wealth.However, the best part of the show was the end. It\\'s the most beautiful thing I\\'ve seen in a show/movie in a very very long time. That one thing balances out the nihilism and overall bleakness of human nature the show is spilling over with.It\\'s just six episodes long, as opposed to the meandering and repetitive 16 episodes that most Korean shows tend to be. I suppose we have Netflix to thank for it, as they impose that condition, and have managed to get some really good shows produced, e.g., Squid Game, D. P., and the entertaining My Name.There\\'s no point talking about the making of the show and other technical accomplishments. And those don\\'t matter to me much. If a show can pull me in into its world. Regardless of the nature of that world, and keep me invested in the characters and the events, then that show has done pretty much everything right. So was the case with this one as well.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:\\nThe show suggests there will be another season. In and of itself, the show is complete. It reaches its conclusion, and there are plenty of answers one can extract from it. The last-minute \"twist\" was unwarranted and made me go, \"Oh, come on. Not you, too\", a reaction identical to the one I had after watching another amazing show, \"Squid Game\". To me, the \"twist\" just overcomplicates the narrative, which clearly wasn\\'t required. I guess the financials took precedence over art here, yet again. Or, maybe, the story was conceived this way from the beginning. Regardless, I don\\'t like it. Too many shows and their impacts have been ruined because of this stupidity.Another complaint, although this is just me nitpicking, is that one of the main characters in the first half of the show is abruptly dropped, never to be seen again in the latter part. He was a prominent character, and no reference was made of him in the second half. That just stuck out like a sore thumb for me.BOTTOMLINE:\\nAfter a bit of world-building, the show gets going, and is relentless in its bleakness and just the overall human a$$holery. As mentioned, the beautiful end is the only moment you get some respite from all the doom and gloom. If you can digest all of this, then the show should be an unforgettable experience for me, just as it was for me.',\n",

You start getting bored because everyone and everything is getting more and more careless. You want to get back to the mainplot and want more explanation. Instead your being pulled into part 4 by force and manipulation and just when the company realizes your about to shut down on everything, they come up with a \"BANG\" shock-effect...and there you go, now they got your attention again. Oh boy. Now you have to watch another 3 parts until the grand-finale...that must be something, you think.But instead you get the finger again, sorry to say dude. You have to wait to season 2.Thats what Hellbound is all about. Something you will not return to, not after this insultment.Its dull, boring, a global evolution that matters all religions but moves only around a handfull of these same people, like they where the only men or women around. This is how stupid it is. No media, coverage, no politics, no science. No answers. And the road to the finale can ONLY disappoint even further. You would never recognize the actors on the streets if you saw them afterwards, trust me.So avoid it, and save your time for your girlfriend...before she becomes your ex by seeing this s... :-))',\n",

But no one realized how absurd is this and no one tried to stop it at all, instead, they use this theory giving mental pressures to the ones that doesn\\'t believe this.

This is based on a misunderstanding of the premise of this film.A lot of people are finding trouble how to interpret this series and are frustrated with character arcs that seem to end nowhere.Well that's the point. All the characters are completely mediocre, selfish, boring, and don't really have amazing character growth that people are used to in a character propelled story. This is not that and if you want to watch something like that, steer clear of this one.If you want the characters to discover the source of the angels and rules behind the burning/sending to hell? Don't bother watching the series because you will not get satisfaction.This is about how do mundane public react to extraprdinary circumstances that cannot be explained by anything we've normally used to explain things. People are at a loss. Nobody knows what in the hell is going on. And there seems to be absolutely no way to fix the situation and the whole world knows about it (Not like final destinations where it's a journey of few individuals to attempt to escape their fate while everybody else lives not knowing a thing about it). How will the world react? What choices will be made and how do those choices change when more information is revealed which contradicts the earlier choices. It's about us. What will you do?We don't know what's behind the angels/god. And we likely will never know but it's not something we can easily ignore as people are being burned alive by monsters on a daily basis.

Reading the other reviews, there's a notable theme going on, and it seems that most of the people rating it very low are also the people that stopped watching after 2 or 3 episodes. I mean, if you're going to rate a show, at least watch the full thing.Very much enjoyed this show, because of course the trailer sucked me straight into wanting to watch it. It's Korean, it has supernatural elements, it's dark, it's gritty and yes it's brutal. I went into it thinking I knew what to expect, where it was going to go and assumed it was going to be action packed with monsters running around tearing people to shreds. It very much delivers A LOT more than that, so expect a bit more of a slow burner bit with good character story development.However, when it's time and the hellbound monsters do show up, the scenes deliver the anticipation, fear and bloody gore you've been waiting for.I'm not really sure why some people have rated it so low, either you haven't invested in the full 6 epsiodes, or you just assumed it was going to be lots of bloody monster killings like Sweet Home. I'd say, give it a watch regardless of the reviews your read, because if you invest into the story AND actually watch it to the very end, you'll probably understand a lot more of what story they are trying to tell....plus the last episode is awesome!\",\n",

You will realize how religion play in societal problems and how they can manipulate facts and tailor them according to their OWN standards.I really like how factual some of the scenes are and how it reflects humans while experiencing crisis. The story reflects despair, agony, and hardships and how a certain belief can be unfair for some. Again don't watch this if you are not a type of cinephile who doesn't want to think and loves to consume the message of a series/movie in a silver platter.Lastly, I gave this a 9 because although I love the plot, some of it, I think was patterned in a pre-existing movie/series and then constructed together.

It doesn\\'t make sense.I have watched bad series, horrible ones. But they all had an explanation, some story, whether that was sensible or not. Hellbound does not have that. Till the end, we have no freaking clue as to what these monsters are and why they send people to hell.It was implied that a lot of the people who were hellbound did not majorly \"sin\". What even is \"sin\" here? Why are these poor people thrashed around and tortured? Even if they come back at the end, it doesn\\'t get rid of the fact that they suffered badly. So it\\'s clear that the supernatural force behind this is not righteous itself.2. It\\'s all about social commentary?People keep commenting that this is not about the monsters, but about society and human nature. I\\'m sorry, are we supposed to be blown away by this revelation that humans can be terrible?? *gasp* I never considered that.WE ALREADY KNOW. We\\'ve seen this repeated in countless TV series, movies, and everyday life. The only new concept here is these big yeti monsters and they couldn\\'t explain them. So, don\\'t tell me it\\'s not about the monsters taking people to hell when the show is literally named HellBound and it very much is about the freaking monsters.Was I horrified by the actions of the Arrowhead folks and the cult? Yes. Surprised? No. That\\'s what mobs are like and it is highly likely something like that would happen.Does that mean you skimp on the storyline and pass it off as some clever angle??3. It is deeply saddening and disturbing.Now, when I say this, I don\\'t mean I can\\'t handle sadness. Squid Game had heartbreaking moments. So did Train to Busan. But those two were absolute masterpieces. Hellbound should not even be compared with them. I\\'m surprised at how many people are saying this is better than Squid Game. In my opinion, no. No it is not.This series may leave you feeling mentally exhausted.My overall review- I\\'ve watched some pretty bad series but this is one of the very few that I actually regret watching. I think it is past the redeeming point and they won\\'t be able to explain it properly anymore. But I\\'d be happy to be proved wrong.Was it scary? Yes, and disturbing.

I got no answers.-MAJOR SPOILER ALERT-Don\\'t read beyond this if you\\'re yet to watch the series^^^^^^Let\\'s talk about that last episode.How could the baby have survived? Seriously, how? I was glad that it was alive, but come on. These monsters have huge rods as claws and they have all sorts of contraptions ready to tackle humans. You\\'re telling me that these ruthless monsters could not take apart two fragile tiny(relatively) people. What a joke.Keep in mind that they scorch bones and organs to ashes, but they couldn\\'t scorch a little extra and get to the baby? No sense.Oh, the big bad monsters suddenly got confused?

However, the story gradually became illogical and frustrating over time, such as the minimal interfering of authority over such disastrous events happening in the country, Arrowhead acted like a terrorism organisation while they should also be afraid of committing crime/sin, the stupid actions and reasoning of characters and society, slow and repetitive dialogues, etc.In short, it was a disappointment although last plot can lead to a more interesting story if the show continues.',\n",

It just shredded the religious dogmas to pieces. From the concept of original sin to Messiah complex to false or for that matter any prophethood, gullibility of common men, bigotry, exploitation, papacy, religious texts and their reality, and even specific incidents in religious history like Abrahamic Sacrifise and the crucifixion and one so called miracle after the other, all were put to sword. It addresses the extremism, fundamentalism and cult mentality in a new fashion. Once you peel the superficial violence and look deeper, don\\'t be surprised to see your own image.And all of this is done subtlety but not so subtlety with a supernatural theme. It left clues along with some unanswered questions but made sure for the audience to know that an unexplained phenomena does not mean only one answer.The show has layers and layers and then some. It is portrayed as horror/sci Fi but it\\'s pure philosophy. Watch it for deeper meanings and you will love it, if your mind is still open; well, I know that being a rarity these days.A brilliant show with a last minute twist to make room for a sequel.

All I can say is that the first season made up of only 6 episodes was a 🎢 ride. There were some really unnecessary slow moments, with too much character building, etc. Overall, however, I thought the 1st season was very entertaining. On a separate note, why do the South Korean police officers only carry revolvers?!?

       "   'Hellbound is a unique show that takes a lot of risks - and for me they pay off. It\\'s only 6 episodes, but spans 5 years and follows two distinct sets of characters. While the individual characters aren\\'t quite as fleshed out as they could be because of this, it\\'s the only way to tell a story this big, and they manage to pack a ton of plot into a really tight 6-episode run by focusing the story around two pivotal moments. Each episode further complicates the narrative and subverts expectations in an exciting way, all while remaining true to the characters and the decisions they have to make.The first episode isn\\'t designed to \"hook\" you with huge cliffhangers and the truth and scope of what\\'s going on is revealed slowly - the show really takes some risks here and trusts it\\'s audience a lot to not lose interest in this age of short attention spans, but stick with it and you\\'ll be rewarded.I should also note that Hellbound explores questions of faith and examines how different people choose to find meaning in the supernatural. These are complicated things to discuss in subtitles and some of the shorthand and idioms used in these conversations doesn\\'t translate 1:1. Also, some of the social issues the show is interested in are uniquely Korean - it\\'s hard to imagine police behaving the way they do in the show here in America.If you\\'re looking for a challenging show that\\'s well-written though, it\\'d be hard to do better than Hellbound. If you\\'re the kind of person who doesn\\'t want to think about religion and its role in society, you probably shouldn\\'t watch this show, as you\\'ll likely find it too challenging, like many of the reviewers here.I\\'m sorry it doesn\\'t have enough explosions or car chases for you Chad, but it\\'s weird that you feel so triggered that you have to go online and tell everyone how much you don\\'t care.',\n",

Happens publicly; can be recorded, played on TV and the monsters are pretty much invincible.Suicide doesn't change anything, at set time monsters appear, pull the soul out of dead body and do the same.The series focuses mainly on the repercussions of said phenomenon, with characters being sort of disposable assets for forwarding the events. Is there a main character? Not absolutely sure even after season end.Series explores religious opportunism, weakness of human law, morality, character, psyche and the helplessness of the individual to stand up for personal rights and freedom.The series is boring though.You never get to know a character deeply enough to find them relatable.Certain aspects are never explored.Is the phenomenon global? How are governments tackling this issue.Any alternative theories to what is happening and why?How many people face this everyday? Are the no. Of cases rising or stable?No one has tried to take an experiment based approach to avoid the monsters? Go underground, go sky diving, go high speed biking. How far long has one been able to avoid getting killed by running, How invulnerable are the monsters? High caliber guns, bombs, missiles, Acid, Lava, Poison gas, holy water. Anything works?For a series this slow and long.

There is an explained magical phenomenon happening in a modern society. Nobody can explain it. People are dying. People get panicked. Then some self-proclaimed deacons enter the scene and assure that they are the God's messenger. This is exactly how religion is formed.Now lets go back 2000 years ago. People then thought that they were the most modern society. They saw a new unexplained phenomenon that then-science could not explain (consider plague, consider some guy went into a coma and came to life 3 days later). Some self proclaimed deacons told everyone to follow their orders because God told them so. Does it sound familiar? This is the story of all organized religions in every era of human history in every corner of the earth.Please, please, do not watch this masterpiece as a horror/thriller/sci-fi movie. You will be disappointed. Rather consider the monsters as an unexplained phenomenon that the science of a modern society can't explain. Rest of the story is self-evident. Initially, people saw that sinners were dying. Then some followers started dying. Then a baby died. Clearly, past/present sins had nothing to do with it. On the other hand, the deacons were quite clearly conspiring to keep themselves in power without thinking of sins. What does the situation resemble?

Don\\'t watch it because you see it in the Top 10 or because it\\'s trendy. You need to have the stomach for it, and it could make you very depressed so if you are not in an happy place in your life, my advice would be to wait before you get better before watching this.

       " 'Binsenjo': [[\"The best part is watching the boyish faced SJK in elegant suits do mafia like things in Korea. I just want to laugh whenever he does his thing. The classical music and opera is well used. The end of each episode is funny and something outrageous usually happens to get you to tune in to the next episode. The first episode was strong with the contrast between how he deals with bad guys in Italy and Korea. Timely nod to Purdue Pharma narcotic issues in episode 3. Episode 4 is quite grand and past things come together.The bad part is subsequently the humour is often painful and the unnecessary overacting of Jeon Yeo Bin is hard to watch. Ok Taecyeon is almost unrecognisable as the goofy intern but his hairstyle changes as he does. Excellent supporting actor Kwak Dong Yeon is a memorable here as a bad guy.I'm still hoping the series will get better and things will get funnier and less painful. They try for jokes when it isn't necessary and it often fails. Even Itaewon Class was funnier and it wasn't mainly a comedy because they reserved jokes for when it counted. Culture clash has the potential for much laughter but it isn't well used. The reactions of the actors are too exaggerated. So many scenes could have been cut.\",\n",
       "   'Korean Drama \" Vincenzo \" had a good concept but there were times that it didn\\'t make it work.The main problem with this drama is the length. It\\'s not only twenty episodes long, each episode also was about an hour and twenty minutes. However, the story was not for that length. Therefore, there were episodes, especially the final ones, when the story was full of fillers, unnecessary twists, and ridiculous situations that were trying too hard to be funny. The blend, though, of action, comedy, and legal themes was an interesting combination that worked for most of the cases. Most of the characters were also pretty interesting, though some of them, like the piano lady and the female lead, were annoying and it was obvious that they were written to be eccentric, but that was presented in a way that screamed try-hard. The villain was a boring character in the second half of the drama. However, it must be noted that the big twist was an innovative one and pretty entertaining.As for the performances, everyone did a great job, especially the male lead who finally found the right character for his proper comeback after the big hit DOTS.So, overall, six out of ten.',\n",
       "   'Review By Kamal KAlthough the episodes are longer than normal Kdramas and one episode is 80+ mins, but the story was pretty comprehensive! Not draggy and fast paced, especially in the second half!It all presented in a dark comedy kind of series, with a righteous leader, great amount of fighting scenes, a storyline of corruption and some witty yet hilarious plot throughout. I really enjoyed all of these because it just had all the humour, emotional and thrill in a show, really exciting and fun to watch! This drama in some ways, blows my mind with the integration of mafia and allows all the killing and gun shooting. Well honestly it\\'s kinda weird if you were to think how the male lead can \"lawfully\" kill and torture so many people, but in other way of thinking, these were the best parts of the show!! I don\\'t know about the others, but I just find all the parts where the king of evil are dealing with the demons were so satisfying to watch! So, I just chose to savor it, don\\'t care if it makes any sense, as long as it entertains!Applaud to all the casts, they were all equivalently goooood! Song Joong Ki literally slayed the role and was really cool in all his fighting scenes! Not to say, it really gave me a great laugh whenever he was being \"harassed\" by numerous guys hahaha! Literally everyone in the show is treating him like a meat on the plate! XD Taecyeon was pretty good too, although I personally find him not so suitable for the role, his face just looks too kind for the role, doesn\\'t look bad and scary at all, the starting part of him being a dumb innocent rookie suits him much better! But it was a great spinoff in his acting career, good for him! :) Dongyeon, as good as always, he always pulls off all kinds of characters, a cool one, a psycho or even a coward but kind-hearted little brother. Gosh, and why do his roles always make people wanna protect him so much?Well, I would say maybe not all might enjoy this, but generally, YES! This doesn\\'t have much love story (almost none?), it\\'s more about a deep end conspiracy with a group of people led by a mafia lawyer to fight crime and save the day!!! So if you are looking for a good story, this is it!',\n",
       "   'Honestly, I sort of enjoyed the early episodes that melded violent crime with slapstick. But it morphed into slapstick and soap opera. Over the top acting, plot and generally silly, cringeworthy scenes.A meandering mess that forced me to stop after 7 episodes. I checked to see if I was near the end and was horrified to see how many more we due to follow. A horror show.Oh, and once an episode our handsome hero throws his lighter away with dramatic effect to burn some major plot location down. Within five minutes we see him annoyingly flicking his trusty lighter that must have magical powers to resist in his hand. OMFG. 🙄',\n",
       "   \"I thought the first half was uneven and could be substantially cut, making a 16 ep series. I thought the second half was as good as any fine Korean series-meaning superb. I stayed with it because of the fabulous cast-terrific on all levels-and was rewarded. The ending was satisfying even if graphic, but hey, don't mess with a mobster's mom, you twits. I loved the sweet pigeon bromance and pigeon onslaught, and the masterful reverse image of the raven. That was revoltingly satisfying as well. And yes there is even romance and a great kiss, too. All in all, Vincenzo is worth the time spent.\",\n",
       "   'The stylish visuals and rather interesting premise made me hope for something different, but in the end, \"Vincenzo\" is just one more cheesy Korean drama with soap opera level writing and cringeworthy humor. It could have worked as a \"so bad it\\'s good\" show, but episodes are too long and possibly slower than arthouse cinema, with the same gags repeated all over again, embarrassing product placement, and endless slow-motion shots with people walking along hallways to show off or do funny faces. The humor rests mainly on the contrast between the dark tone of the main story and the goofiness of the support characters, but the jokes are corny and the performances are utterly annoying.The protagonist is a Korean-born, Italian-raised mafia lawyer who is back in his motherland to deal with unfinished business. Yet there is nothing Italian about him - he just slurs random Italian sayings and listens to opera while drinking red wine (come on!!). He is supposed to be a cold-blooded mafia consigliere, yet they spend half of the series trying to justify his extreme actions as if he was a hero forced to fall to the same level as his enemies. The sparse moments of action are extremely dull and formulaic, but I have to admit that there are also a few absolutely crazy but undeniably original plot resolutions every now and then.',\n",
       "   'A Korean Working for an Italian mafia family as a consigliere returns to Korea to retrieve hidden gold in a dilapidated block. Here he gets involved with the shopkeepers in the block and when he comes up against a corrupt psychotic businessman things soon escalate out of control. An interesting story which is quite violent at times and leaves the viewer rooting for the anti hero even though his methods are probably more severe then the villains. Overall well acted with interesting story and characters which leaves you wondering if violence is ever acceptable.',\n",
       "   \"A feel good Italian mafia comedy is hard to come by. Let alone a Korean one.To feel good the good guys had to win. All the time. But such is not the case here. There are lots of death here. Very calculated. And many fight scenes, albeit simplified and comedic. Together with a fairly sizeable support cast. And most are really one dimensional. Only the 3-4 are somewhat fully fleshed out.The evil ones are really evil. The slimy one stays slimy. The comedy sidekicks also. No one changed a bit except the female lead.And there are loads of side stories. The underling brother, the treasure hunter, the hidden talents, the McGuvin , the tribute to the French Revolution, modern dance, Italian food, and even the pigeon gets to be hero for a day.It's entertaining, but this is just pass your time tv drama, at its best.\",\n",

       "   '8/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Action and Crime drama with 20, approximately 80 minute episodes.Park Joo-hyung (Song Joong-ki) grew up in Italy. At eight years old he was adopted and harbors resentment towards his Korean mother who he feels abandoned him. He later becomes part of the Italian mafia and is such an asset the head, Don Fabio, adopts him. As a member of the Cassano family Joo-hyung is renamed Vincenzo Cassano. He becomes a lawyer and utilizes his skill as he works as a representative for his adopted father in mafia dealings. When the father dies, the biological son attempt to kill Vincenzo and, after taking revenge, Vencenzo flees the country back to South Korea.In Seoul, Vincenzo goes to the the Geumga Plaza which is a site where he helped a Chinese tycoon hide 1.5 tons of gold and install tenants to disguise the real intention of the building.The Chinese tycooln is dead, and ownership of the gold now falls to the Cassano family, and Vincenzo plans to recover the gold for himself. Of course, the building has been taken over by a South Korean crime organization in the form of a pharmaceudical company, the Babel group. The Babel group has been strong arming the tenants so Vincenzo decides to team up with one of the tenants, a lawyer, to take down the Babel group. The lawyers daughter, Hong Cha-young (Jeno Yeo-been) was originally represting Babel but after her father is murdered by them, joins up with Vincenzo to exact revenge on the Babel Group. Sparks had originally flown between the two but as they unite toward a common purpose those strong feelings evolve to something more.Overall, I liked this series a lot. All of the actors, and you had a pretty much all star cast with a few exceptions, did an amazing job acting out their characters. The storyline was exciting and the villians were incredibaly villanous. The whole \"it takes a villian to catch a villian\" axiom was true throughout the series. The chemistry between the two leads was not immediate, which made sense to me because they did not start out liking each other but developed a deep friendship through working to take down a common enemy.*Spoilers The pros were the incredible acting, great locations and filming, and appropriate but not too invasive musical scores. Who doesn\\'t love Song Joon-ki in action, he is incredibly handsome and charasmatic. The sense of community with the building tenants was both refreshing and engaging. I loved that Cha-young was a tough, no nonsense lawyer with a bit of a dark streak. It made her the perfect pairing for Vincenzo because she did not have an issue, if justice would not be served, with going outside of the law. I loved that there was gold hidden in the building and how disturbed Vincenzo would get whenever someone would pursue his gold. He reminded me, in those cases, of a Leprechaun guarding his gold. One of the most comedic scenes was when he had to pretend to be gay to lure in a bank that was willing to work with Babel. Whether you are gay trying to be heterosexual or heteresexual tying to be gay if you are engaging the sexuality that does not fit - it is cringy. I was laughing, so hard during that part. The funny thing, was he seemed to turn all the guys around him gay. The men seemed to love him as much as the women did. It was like everyone\\'s dark fantasy, apprently, to be in the mob. So there were bromances galore.The cons were the times that Vincenzo failed to stay true to character. What it seemed, was he was a South Korean child, adopted into the Italian culture but was old enough to remember the language and most of the culture of his original country. His anger at his mother for \"abandoning\" him, and the death of his foster parents through criminal activity, led him to embrace the dark side for revenge. I got that. Made sense. But, it showed, in so many ways that he was very humane and caring and had conscience and could love and all that - not even a sociopath because he wasn\\'t simply \"blending in\" his feelings appeared genuine and he underwent an evolution through meeting and falling in love with Cha-young, being mentored and befriended by her father, and just forming so many friendships in South Korea. But then, his mother, who he was on the precipice of a true reunion with, is murdered and it is like it flipped a switch. He backtracked on all the progress he made and the brutal element fully came back in him. The fact that he had flashbacks and nightmares of past incidents clearly showed that he had remorse to that point. But then it was like he became a slightly different person after his mother\\'s death. I thought the way he killed the Babel villians was just a bridge too far. I cannot reconcile burning someone to death with someone who is a good person. Although the chairman was evil and had done horrible things, drilling someone to death is just the next level of brutality. Becoming as evil as the evil you are punishing does not make you a good person. I was disappointed when he blew up Cha-young\\'s father\\'s killer. He broke his word in my opinion. HHe told him once he did this thing the debt was fulfilled and he could go free. It was dishonest and it seemed even Cha-young felt he had gone too far. But she never said that although her response to the news seemed as if it bothered her.When he killed the female lawyer he broke his morale code which was no women and children. She even said you are going to do this to a woman and he said, basically, you are not a woman, you are a monster. Still, burning her alive was the next level up brutality. It took him from a batman like, superhero justice seeker, to just a murderer little better than the people he was \"punishing\". I also could not buy that the law enforcement friends in his circle were so okay with him brutally murdering those people. They helped him get away with it and even shook hands with and hugged him when he had the blood on him. It was a bit like \"Dexter\" in that dark anti hero type persona but I am just not a fan of that level of \"eye for an eye\" because his treatment of them was even more brutal than the way they treated their victims.The ending also fell short for me. Perhaps they are setting it up for another season. I did not like the very \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" end where he can only come back when on a diplomatic mission (diplomatic immunity). It was over obvious in the postcards he sent that he wanted her to come find him - yet she didn\\'t. To me it seemed as though her emotions toward him took a turn. I did not have the sense she would be willing to leave South Korea and go join him on an island off the coast of Malta. I had no care for his Italian family. We never got to know enough of that piece to care that he had reunited and was now ruling that family. And, we were reminded of his brutality when he mentioned the revenge he took on a rival family and that their remains were fertilizing his grapes. They confessed and kissed but then parted ways with a somewhat sad and whistful look in both of their eyes.His behavior, as other reviewers have pointed out, was not even consistent with what is often the case in organized crime. I knew a situation like that once - one of my best friends in high school let\\'s just say her father was a retired person in a very well known organized criminal entity. In those situations, usually the lawyer is very valuable and also high up in the crime organization. They do not have those folks act as \"hit persons\" they are too valuable to the organization. And they typically have done their dues and don\\'t want to get their hands dirty that way. Not that they have suddenly grown a conscience, but they just don\\'t do the dirty work anymore. So that did not make sense. He was a lawyer and the second in command - the family would typically not risk such an individual by involving them so intimately. Even if he, himself, wanted to be involved, unless there was a compelling reason he would usually be ordered by \"the boss\" not to.That being said - I would still recommend it and might even rewatch it at some point. It is unique and so well acted that the flaws are not a complete deterrant. Others really liked it and did not consider these things flaws. Cha-young had just enough darkness in her to accept a lot of what he did. It was very \"Game of Thrones\" in the darker elements and how most of the characters were not completely good or completely evil but various mixes thereof. And how you were rooting for anti heroes. The \"Queen of Dragons\" in Game of Thrones reminded me of Vincenzo in the way their characters evolved and the sudden switch down a much darker path. But I wasn\\'t a fan of how that ended either. I like redemption and character growth. This followed the opposite trajectory. If there were a second season I might watch it. I am extremely disappointed in the brutality of the murders so I can\\'t think of a way back from that but would be interested to see where their relationship evolved.',\n",
       "   \"I thought it would be difficult for Joongki to have another love team after the divorce but interestingly the netizen liked the girl. She is not as pretty as the other female leads before but she is funny and had a strong character. Her acting is not annoying either so I guess the netizens fell for this girl too. I like the plot of how each villain ended. I was shocked of how Vincenzo's character was really dark but I guess it will not make sense if it is not related to Mafia. The supporting characters had each unique contributing roles that came as a surprise. Overall I really liked this kdrama but it I think Joongki's acting can still be improved. I also wished that he avenged himself on the two robbers who stole his watch in the first episode.\",\n",
       "   'You can see the cast had a lot of fun making this Italian/Korean would-be mafia thriller, the sort of fun NOT experienced in Hollywood since the days of Burt Reynolds. Vincenzo contains a very absorbing plot, a cast star-struck by designer clothes, interspersed with Italian (and other) Classical music excerpts to set in relief some well written suspense and intrigue. The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo\\'s Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called \"hit\" US shows. So far, so good, Binjenzo!',\n",

In fact he was a Mafia Consigliere or Advisor.He wears the best Italian clothing, which makes Vincenzo \"Cassanova\" (as people call him) stand out in modern day Seoul. There\\'s dueling law firms,\\ncrazy gangsters, nutty tenants in a building with a \\'secret\\' - and Vincenzo is ably\\nassisted by the gorgeous and feisty \"Ms. Hong\" - also a lawyer.I really enjoyed watching this -12 x \\'2 hr\\' episodes so far; awaiting more next week, and if you want to have a good nights viewing, give this a go.',\n",
       "   'I just started this and it is already so interesting. Song Joong Ki is the main actor and he is such a spunk.He arrives in Korea and straight away the people he meets rip him off. They don\\'t know that he was part of the mafia in Italy. Now they have illegally taken away his building. They don\\'t know what they have done. What he will do to get it back.Oooooh! It\\'s exciting and fun. They are underestimating him at every turn. They don\\'t know the terrible things he\\'s done in the name of the mafia.As well as that he has got an Italian palate and doesn\\'t like the Korean way of cooking it. Lol!Song Joong Ki looks so clean cut, sleek and immaculate but his favourite means of revenge is fire and intimidation. He recruits his team of collaborators from those hurt by the chemical firms.I love this drama so much Song Joong Ki has transformed himself into this pseudo-villain and he and Jun Yeo Bin have this Bonnie and Clyde vibe going on. It\\'s so sexy, provocative and vexatious. Wow! Just want the episodes to keep flowing forward. Every week is like a taster for the next exciting event and experience. I can\\'t wait for what they are going to reveal next, because the real villain has materialized and shocked us all.Some episodes are just crazy and Kim Yeo Jin/Choi Myung Hee is just the wrong actress for this. I don\\'t find her that believable in that part. I just find her pathetic and inadequate when she overacts. Not like Song Joong Ki/Vincenzo Cassano he is so cool, handsome and has that dangerous vibe going on.The brother\\'s, thought it\\'s hard to get the handle on them. Mr Lunatic and Mr Wimp, I wonder how this is going to pan out Then there\\'s the tenants Maybe the Wimp, brother, is the craziest but Mr Lunatic doesn\\'t know it yet.The older brother has been bullying his brother since they were children.A vagrant told them about the hidden gold but thy don\\'t seem believe him even when he shows photographs of it. Still they don\\'t want to move out of the building. They are setting up a protest. They begin to look for the gold tell each other all kinds of lies over it..\\nI like Vincenzo Cassano and Hong Cha Young\\'s relationship of equality. She is what we call in New Zealand, a hardcase, funny yet super intelligent. She has guessed that he is in the Mafia. She is getting feelings for him but they don\\'t have chemistry yet. She is such a comedian.Vincenzo Cassano biological mother is dying and on the execution list for a murder she didn\\'t commit. He has been ignoring her because she abandoned him and that is why he ended up with Italian adopted parents, but I think that he is beginning to get compassion for her.He finds out that that the bank chairman was the one who set her up. He is preparing for his own revenge. His cohorts are setting him up to seduce the Banks chairman. Through this he finds out what happened to his mum and how she went to jail . That motivates him to carry on with the plan and act as if he is gay.Vincenzo Cassano looks so awesome on a horse.This drama has it\\'s comedic moments then back to serious and deadly. Roll on next weekWell yeah! There was a bit of a lull mid drama but the real villain has hotted things up with a spate of killings. The brothers Jang Jun Woo (Mr Lunatic) and and Han Seo (Mr Wimp) but I think that both of them are totally psychopathic. The older brother has Daddy issues that haven\\'t really been explained or I missed it.Vincenzo Cassano has mummy issues stemming from him being abandoned in and orphanage when he was young but he coming to the realisation that his mum had reasons for it that he didn\\'t know of when he was a child.I was looking at the name Vincenzo it reminds me of incendio.English translation of \\'incendio\\'\\nincendio\\nMASCULINE NOUN\\nfireShades of my Harry Potter experiences.This cold hearted man is getting feelings for this girl that he has no chemistry with the leading female. Yikes! No way!Parts of this is really funny.I thought that they had no chemistry but that kiss in the art gallery was perfectly passionate and they were both encapsulated by it and brought more meaning to their relationship than they had ever dared. Although reluctant at the beginning they kissed over and over. They were both surprised especially him who had never even thought of having feelings for another human being. He had trained himself to be aloof, distant and indifferent. Suddenly their emotions had opened up a new conduit. Now things are a bit awkward for our leading man and woman. They pass it off as acting and laugh it off.The other couple who they were impersonating were having their own Korea experience and proposal with the the residents of Geumga Plaza.How did he know that assassins would come to the roof? He sent Hong Cha Young away to get beer. I rewound. He saw the two guys reflected in something. It\\'s a warning when you hear him flicking that lighter opening and shutting. He thinks his foster brother sent them. He was right.How funny the pigeon came to help him. I knew they had to have some important role in this drama. It\\'s a bit comedic really. You just have to smile.Wow! First time I\\'ve actually seen the antagonist actually break a persons arm when I often shout out break his arm. Was this a forewarning? He is so thankful to the pigeons. Then he says \"How can pigeon save a man?\"Wow! This is comedic in places but it is also powerful. Don\\'t try and double cross the Mafia. Is regret really the most painful thing in life? Have I got regrets. I do but they don\\'t really bring me pain even at this stage in my life I still think I can fix them up.I can\\'t believe people drink coffee that is civet poop. I\\'m glad I\\'m not a coffee drinker.These slow motion hugs are so good. Soong Joong Ki is such an outstanding actor. His small measured movements convey so much power and emotion. His face tries to be emotionless and stoic but they show a different meaning to the viewer.After they killed his mother he went on an arm breaking spree. I always wanted to see arm breaking and here it is at last. Now they will learn what real retribution is. So exciting so violent so bad. Just love it and even though I don\\'t want to. I can wait for the finale. I hope that it is breathtakingly awesome.It pays not to wait to tell people that you love them. She was the only person that he was closely related to. This is so good but he can\\'t die he is the main actor. First time I\\'ve ever said this in an Asian Drama.This drama was special. I loved it. It filled my predictions, hopes and of event anticipations.I was reading other peoples reviews and I don\\'t agree with their negative thoughts. I watch movies drama to be entertained not to find faults with the productions. For me most of what I watch is entertaining and fun.',\n",

While trying to retrieve the gold he comes across a corporate company Babel that gets things done in an evil manner. So Vincenzo teams up with a competent lawyer Hong Cha young to take down the evil Babel group. What makes this show a stand out is the methods used to bring down the corporation. Vincenzo gives a taste of mafia to the evil corporate while at the same time tries to retrieve the gold.It is truly a glorious show and gets you hooked on to it from the first episode itself. The casting is fabulous and the actors have done a good job. The background score itself is sufficient for you to have goosebumps.

       "   \"The premise of Vincenzo immediately sparks interest: a Korean born yet Italian naturalized lawyer is a very stylish and cold consiglieri to an Italian maffia family. Through some criminal circumstances he finds himself back in South Korea looking to seize on a (literally) golden opportunity. He camps out in a building that is to be demolished and is surrounded by its weird and wonderful tenants, facing a choice: do I support these lower class citizens or do I take a more opportune road?What follows are a few very funny episodes that establish the many colorful characters and leave you grasping for answers. After what I can only describe as a very cool build up, in episodes three and four those questions get answered in ways that will surprise even the most knowledgeable viewers. By that time I was invested in the excellently written personas and the developments really hit home.Since it is a Korean series, the differences between the poor and the corrupt rich elite are once again highlighted (a common theme in the often excellent Korean cinema), but with a few great twists. The series has a quirky sense of humor and balances nicely between shocking real world maffia problems and fun. It uses Italian music tropes found in your average Hollywood maffia film in a Korean setting, which works out brilliantly.The stylish star of the show is both likeable and pretty scary at the same time while he's being tested in ways he did not even encounter during his time in the Italian maffia. It's a surprisingly fun ride, fantastically filmed and edited, has great use of music and had me thinking 'oh, hell yes' on several occasions.Sometimes it takes a monster to defeat other monsters. And as monsters go, Vincenzo is a definitely among the more compelling.A great watch.\",\n",

PredictableVincenzo is our anti-hero who is devoted to family, reads books like how to befriend birds, and also takes revenge using the spear of atonement. He doesn't believe in serving justice, so he formulated a set of strict principles to avenge crime as a vigilante with calm precision.The show organically shifts between crime, comedy and romance so it feels quite realistic. The plot is- the fall of a psychopath, and how pain stacking difficult it is, thanks to the corrupt judicial system and government. I loved many pop culture references like the miserable ones, modern art and other classic super-rich mafia thrill. In terms of direction, the show is super engaging especially when it interacts with the audience by breaking the 4th wall and also empowering the average civilians within the show. There is no unnecessary bloodshed and nudity like the usual US made shows in this genre, and I appreciate that! The criminals, too get panic attacks like genuine humans :0The show is crime drama heavy so it fills you with adrenaline, but there are technical errors and plot holes. Still the overall script outshines those issues. And of course, to follow up for next seasons they made this one, highly predictable.Overall I loved this show. The social commentary, the drama, everything, kept me on the edge. It's an escapist fever dream from the real-life failures of our society. Can't wait for more.\",\n",

       "   'Vincenzo is an unconventional K-drama. It is a common trope in dramas to have a \"good\" protagonist fighting against evil and injustice. However, in this story, it is evil vs evil, which gives the series a unique perspective. Fantastic work by all the actors, the writer, the director, and the crew. For those seeking a gripping drama with mafia, law, and action, this show is definitely worth watching.',\n",

However I personally think this show has a perfect balance of thriller, action, comedy and suspense. Those who judge shows after watching 1 episode I think are rather stupid. Obviously you're not gonna fully grasp the characters in episode 1/20...that's why there's more episodes. The acting is great, the characters are great, the cinematography is great, some parts you're not supposed to take seriously because they're for comedic purposes. I love the character development too it's amazing. I also love the storyline and the idea of a Korean - Italian mafia...it's quite interesting. I don't wanna give away too much but at least watch til ep 3-4 til you judge. It's definitely worth watching. I like how the romance between the two leads isn't super cliché and isn't the main focus either but it's still there, it's more of a slow burn romance between them. The action scenes are well shot and quite realistic too. Omg I could go on and on about this show I love it so much. Really looking forward to the ending I just finished episode 10 and I couldn't not be anymore eager.\",\n",

       "   \"'a Korean-Italian mafia lawyer' ehh? allright. Only problem is nothing is convincing about the character. Maybe its the writing or that actor himself but there is no authencity to him as an italian lawyer. Not to mention all the cliche you would expect from a Korean show surface within first two episodes. Koreans obsession with Europe and how they romantacise west in their shows is another topic for discussion which i wont get into. But have you noticed that the main lead in korean shows always have some connection with west? I guess it makes them cool and someone with higher status if they have some Italian, American, French etc in their background? anyhow. It could be an interesting premises but so far nothing seems to convince me that he is some hardass lawyer. Everything seems too forced. 4/10 for me.\",\n",
       "   'Well this show was my first watching K-Drama and it was an amazing journey. The comedy was on point, which if not done correctly would have come of as cringey. Drama was there throughout the story and oh my god Vincenzo was awesome.Now lets see what I didn\\'t like. The story was pretty generic and was predictable but that doesn\\'t make the series bad what makes it bad is over stretching it. The entire story could have been completed with half the run time but there were so much filler. There\\'s a sub-plot of the story which is supposedly very important but by the end of the series it turns out to be literally of no use. Too many glaring plot holes but I\\'m ready to ignore them because Vincenzo is awesome. That\\'s also a problem in the pursuit to make Vincenzo great they made him not human, same goes for the villain. Other characters were good. Everyone else felt distinct and unique.It was clear that the writers cannot write a simple Romance subplot, which was disappointing as the actors were very beautiful and played there parts well but bad writing hurt their chemistry. The music is good and sound design is nice. Cinematography is very stylish and at times on the edge of being too much but i liked it.All in all, way too exhausting( about 26 hours and 40 minutes) but yeah you\\'ll enjoy it..and forget it too. I gave it a good score as the comedy held the show together,eventhough the story felt overstretched at times multiple twists will keep you hooked, don\\'t expect to get closure in romance side, message given is \" Money, intelligence, good looks, and ruthlessness if present then anything is possible\" as if no one knew that.Thanks for reading.',\n",

Never laughed out loud so much in any Korean show, and I've been watching them for many years. Moreover, people overlook its social value. It highlights how out of control corruption has gotten, and that a paradigm shift of attitude and approach will be necessary to fight the elite stranglehold on power that exists pretty much all over the world now. I think this goes over most people's heads, sadly. For most people, the series is just entertainment. For me, it's a strategy. Excellent cast and acting. I sure hope the brilliant team that did this show gives us more.\",\n",

Every episode that gets more exciting and surprising in the action of Vincenzo. This kdrama features a lot of cool, satisfying and interesting, hilarious acts with the Plaza Geumga team family. DAMN! I really like Vincenzo Cassano and really the best KDrama and enjoy it as much as possible.',\n",
       "   'Vincenzo started slow with episodes 1 and 2, but by episode 4, the ride was incredibly fast that I was reluctant to call it a day after hours of bingeing over the weekend. It is incredible how a single series can manage to be within seconds funny, serious, suspenseful, thrilling, and towards the end, scary. Yet the quick shifts in tone and mood did not feel jarring or distracting. The plot twists and turns kept me at the edge of my seat.That Vincenzo, in the end, reverts to being the sadistic, violent, and scary member of the Mafia is strangely forgivable, because well... he is with the Mafia.What I liked:\\n1. Cast - Soong Joong-ki seemed to have been tailor fit for his role. Despite his smooth handsome-ness, he managed to be eerily merciless and soul-less when he had to. The rest of the \"Cassano family\" of Geumga Plaza were a riot.2. Storyline - the story is simple, and was carried more by the acting and script. I found myself laughing out loud by myself yet at times hiding behind pillows especially during the last episode. One moment I was laughing at the Guemga Cassano family, the next moment I could barely watch Vincenzo\\'s torturing his enemies.3. Script - catchy, fast. If this were a book, I\\'d be speed-reading it, hardly able to wait for each chapter to get to the next. The funny parts were not comedic, exaggerated, nor slapstick. The sting operations were well-thought off. It reminded me so much of Ocean\\'s 11, but this was Korean-style.4. Soundtrack - helped a lot in the shift of moods. Serious moments were broken by sudden changes in soundtrack mood. Choice of music was excellent.What made my ranking short of 10 are the few lapses and gaps in logic, but easy to let pass:\\n1. I can understand that the whole time, Han-seok and Vincenzo were playing cat and mouse and didn\\'t want to kill each other for the thrill of it. But towards the end, after leaving prison, Han-seok wanted Vincenzo dead once and for all. Couldn\\'t he have just gone to Vincenzo\\'s small settlement unit that didn\\'t even have a security lock, and just shot him dead? They could have at least shown a failed attempt at this.2. That thing about Inzaghi and a whole flock of pigeons saving Vincenzo\\' life.... I have very mixed feelings about this. If there was one thing I was not expecting to be built into the script, it was a minute of fantasy.I was satisfied with the ending. It wasn\\'t open, yet a gap left for a (hopeful) season 2. Minor lapses notwithstanding, this is a show that brought me to one helluva ride. Will definitely watch again.',\n",
       "   \"I get what People say about the show being to corny. It started of great, I was all in, even watching 2 episodes subsequently.He's a great character, being played very well. She was goofy and somewhat funny at first, but started to annoy me a bit after a while.There are a lot of good laughs, don't get me wrong. And the story was interesting. But it all just feels a bit too stretched sometimes, and some of the joking and banter aren't really that funny.The show seems to get more goofy and wacky as it continues.. Or maybe it's only now starting to bore me. Somewhere around episode 10-11 I began to watch only half an episode and later on the other half. Now I even stopped a couple of times after 20 minutes. But now, I finally gave up at episode 14, I don't think I'm gonna finish watching. Ii just lost my interest, to continue watching.\",\n",
       "   \"Vincenzo popped up on my Netflix feed after finishing Kingdom, which in my opinion is one of the best zombie movie/series out there.Vincenzo starts off with a blast, pun intended, and stays pretty steady. However I can't give it a 10 for two reasons: the lead actress and drawing out the episodes.After I got over the initial sour taste of the kdrama formula, which seems to be an odd mix of slapstick comedy and overt violence, I stayed on board through all twenty movie-length episodes. Did you read that? Twenty movie-length episodes. The cat and mouse between Vicenzo and Han Seok was great at times but it became so exhausting that by episode 16 I was like just finish them already!!!!I'm in agreement with several other reviews, the female lead was a weak link. So much so, I fast forwarded over some of her scenes. She wasn't funny and her behavior was more immature/clownish for a lawyer. She only became palatable when she became more of a straight man towards the middle of the series.All in all this was a really good series. The acting was exceptional and the cat and mouse between Vincenzo and Han Seok kept me watching, albeit exhausted, till the end. And I'm even anticipating season 2, if there is one. The episodes just needed to be cut down/or out.\",\n",

It respects the idea of evil because we are really are not always good or right, we are bad too, and the lesson ushered by the main character will stay with me for life .It is an intelligent series, it was only unbelievable once when pigeon saves Vincenzo but I like that too because I am a romantic, rest was a very well researched plot with good looking people.After you have watched it, either you will become Vincenzo or you will want a Vincenzo of your ownPS Vincenzo is beautiful.',\n",
       "   \"I didn't expect much from this show at all. In fact I expected to not even finish the first episode. But boy I'm glad I did.This show surpassed my expectations in the very best way. The show is original and very well written and paced out. Song Joon-ki is awesome, amazing and sexy as hell as Vincenzo. He embodies the role whole heartedly. He makes you laugh, makes you cheer him on to kick ass and tugs on your heart strings. I was incredibly impressed with his skill and dedication to this role. The supporting cast are endearing and throughout the series you get to know a little bit about each one. There is surprisingly a lot of humor, which is honestly a relief because without it the show would be very dark. If I had one gripe it would be sometimes I thought the episodes where a tad long. But on the other hand, you just get to spend more time with Vincenzo and his ragtag group of friends so didn't mind it.This show is just flat out awesome. So much better that whatever Hollywood is peddling out. I hope there's a season two, this show totally deserves it!\",\n",
       "   \"Some say that nothing about this drama is realistic. Others say that the hype is exaggerated. In my case, it is hand down the best drama I've seen. I'm amazed at the many details they put into this drama. The small facial ticks of Joon-Woo when he gets angry, the little smirk Vincenzo gives his foes when he's about to make his surprise move, and Cha-Young's little confidence boost when she's in a dangerous situation. My favourite scenes are those where Vincenzo breaks character, in which he feels uncomfortable. You clearly see our beloved consigliere fighting an internal battle, and thinking\\nabout a way to end this circus show. But when he is about to make a move on his 'chessboard', there is no sign of that man.I have no bad words about this drama. It isn't your typical drama about romance and self-discovery in which most of time you can usually predict the outcome. No, it's filled with well-thoughted out unpredictable plots twists. Like the characters, you are filled with adrenaline and emotions. Sitting in the edge of the couch, you are literally screaming at your screen, applauding their victories and (maybe) crying when something bad happens.I recommend watching this drama!\",\n",
       "   \"While it takes around 3-4 episodes, Vincenzo is undeniably an underrated series that gets overlooked due to the fact it's a K-drama. Although the medium has a reputation for having excessive amount of romance (from what I've heard), Vincenzo is nothing like that, the mild amount of romance does not affect the story in any way.The first 4 episodes are slightly predictable, the rest of the show is a Rollercoaster that will keep you on the edge of the seat.The main character of Vincenzo - Vincenzo Cassano is also really great. Well-written, charming and a straight up overpowered badass, he takes on multiple foes using his wit and experience as a mafia accompanied by a great cast of side characters who are equally as likeable.The show touches on the subject of human greed and Vincenzo must deliver Justice while at the same time tries to grow into a more humble person despite his past life.\",\n",
       "   \"It's pleasing to watch indeed, but I feel I couldn't really relate with the mafia background. Weak, little drawing about this setting, way too superfluous. The main actor here to me is more like a badass business consultant, rather than a mafia lawyer.\",\n",

       "   \"I have to say I started watching K-Dramas early this year. I randomly picked Stranger (Bimilui Soop) season one and when it finished I could hear a click inside my head. South Korean TV shows are in a golden era. Period. After that I've seen many- and I mean MANY - south-korean series. Some are good. Some are VERY good. Few are outstanding. Vincenzo is one of those. Some K-Dramas start very strong with a very good premise. The seasons are long - usually 18 episodes - wich I love as oppose to Netflix' 8 episode standard.Problem is, some of them start decaying by mid-season and entering in a kinda loop of what I'm gonna call 'reminders' - remind me that love, remind me that song, remind me that character's line. And that love (again)... over and over- There's practically none of that here. The characters (and the writing) are busy enough through the 20 episodes not to fall in that cliché. Keeps the bar pretty high through the entire season.As for the acting.. Oh, boy. It's been some time since I loved every single one of the characters in a show. And I don't want to spoil anything to those whom might read this lines. The outstanding support cast does a fantastic job. The main characters are first class. Song Joong-ki, and Yeo-bin Jeon are great in their roles. But I would give an award to every one of the characters (that lawyers, that father, mother, that brothers, that community) as they made me happy and sad and laugh and cry and frightened and relief.

In practise, I can at best describe it as a strange mix of black comedy, mixed with action and horror elements. Truly a strange mix, which ends up being confusing and you end up on a rollercoaster, but one that is moving in all directions!The whole story did not make any sense and was far from credible and may be culturally insensitive. A Korean adoptee who can speak fluent Korean and Italian with a heavy Korean accent. Right...! The development of the characters was stale and the plot twists may be surprising, but totally ridiculous.The sub-plot where Vincenzo was gay baiting someone was truly offensive. In this time of inclusion, I found this highly cringe and insensitive. It may be normal for a Korean audience, but in the rest of the world this is not done.We see through the episodes the violence escalating. Where it starts relatively innocent, it escalates into something increasingly more gruesome and gore. Culminating in the torture and demise of the antagonists: stabbing in the neck where we see blood pouring out, live burning of a woman and the slowly drilling to death of the \"end boss\". It intends to shock and wrap up the story, but I found it unnecessary, unsatisfactory and out of context with the vibe of the other episodes.The acting of some characters was quite good though, notably the main protagonist Vincenzo (Song Joong-ki) and the antagonists Choi Myung-hee (Kim Yeo-jin), Jang Han-seo (Kwak Dong-yeon) and Jang Han-seok (Ok Taec-yeon). I can appreciate their performance. It is just that everything else was incoherent and a confusing mess.And what about the take home message of Vincenzo? There is no justice in this world. An eye for an eye. Torture and killing is okay. It is okay to take matters in your own hand. How can you spread such a message? Truly incredible!',\n",

K drama carrying 20 episodes should give a ending blast but this drama fails to do that.IF you personally liked the main character you want to see a harsh judgement made by him which is clearly missing. After episode 12 it feels slightly moving on slow pace.',\n",

Still not sure if I'm enjoying the idea that you can only beat bad guys with an even bigger bad guy (as that seems antithetical to a number of the main character ideals) but overall the writing and plot twists are done well. Highly recommended at this stage.\",\n",
       "   \"Entertaining, gripping plot. Once you start watching, you just won't be able to stop. Yes, the plot is this good and Song Jongki's acting is top-notch. The chemistry between the leads is off the charts, though it's not a romantic drama, and there is a good amount of comedy, which balances the darker scenes. I would describe Vincenzo as an emotion rollercoaster, sometimes you are laughing out loud and are then taken aback by a dramatic, suspenseful scene. What I didn't like was the portrayal of Vincenzo in the last episodes, something which I will not spoil happened and he seemed far too passive and unprepared compared to how badass and cunning he had been shown to be. However, the ending did the character justice, so it was realistic enough. All in all, this drama is top-notch for me. If you are wondering whether or not to watch this, just do it already. I promise you won't regret it!!!\",\n",

But after giving it a try I can say without a doubt, that this is definitely an amazingly well-crafted Thriller series.The show has really great themes on the ascepts of Justice and Human evil, with a lot of well-crafted plot twists that wouldn't know what would happen next. It takes a lot of Italian mafia elements and makes it into it's own style. I also hear that a lot of k-drama have some excess amounts of romance and rom-com but Vincenzo isn't one of those, there are obviously romance scenes here and there, but they're at a tolerable amount and do not distract you from the main story, it's primary focus is the Thriller and comedy aspects.It's a perfect blend of Thriller, Action and Comedy although I'll agree that not everyone can get accustomed to the k-drama-esque comedy and may even find it cringey at times. But you're able to look past that, I'm sure you will have an amazing experience.\",\n",

       "   \"Just finished watching the season finale, having watched 1-2 episodes of Vincenzo every day.I started watching it on Netflix UK out of idle curiosity after seeing the giant thumbnail. I got hooked, and so did my family. I'm someone who has accidentally got into KDramas due to lockdown.Vincenzo is a superb thriller, with comedy breaks in it to reduce the tension when it gets too taut.It as about 4 plots, sub-plots, and is (except for the occasional lapse) VERY well written. And the writers delight in mixing genres- gangster, legal drama, heists- to name but a few. And they delight in fooling the audience.It is EXTREMELY well cast.Song Joong-ki is phenomenal in the title role. Cool, a strategist, always elegantly suited and booted, he plays a Korean who was adopted by Italians and grew up in a Mafia family, rising to the role of consigliere. He uses his intellect against opponents, taking on corrupt lawyers, politicians, businessmen, judges, prosecutors.But he can also be extremely violent when necessary.Jeon Yeo-been is also well cast as a feisty, designer clad, relentless, sharkish corporate lawyer Hong Cha-young, turned fighter for justice who becomes his partner in legal vigilantism after her idealistic father is murdered by corporate baddies.The villains are many. And varied in their villainy. K-Dramas can do female villains extremely well, some are absolutely frightening and Kim Yeo-jin was a standout as a truly evil woman, Choi Myung-hee, a lawyer more deadly than any thug. The ultimate baddy is terrifying. A psychotic sadist who can be harming one minute, vicious the next. Don't want to give the actor's name as he's a surprise twist!The supporting cast were amazing. I became a huge fan of the actors who portrayed the shopkeeper-residents of an ageing mall...where years before a Chinese criminal and Vincenzo had hidden in a vault under the mall basement, billions worth of gold bars statues... and a usb stick with info on corrupt bigshots in Korea that could bring down the rich and powerful. The mall residents have their own stunning reveals, in the twisting, turning plot.Vincenzo's departure from Italy after a brief power struggle, returning to Korea to retrieve the gold, is the catalyst for a roller coaster chain of events that had me and my family gasping, shrieking, hiding our eyes, and bingeing on this dramatic feast. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was some unnecessary weakness in the writing in parts of the last 2 episodes.I can't recommend it too highly.\",\n",
       "   \"I highly recommend this to anyone that likes the revenge theme. It also feels very different from other k-series. It does not get cheesy nor fluffy. It stays serious until the very last episode. In my opinion it was an acceptable end because we all know there is no way out of mafia and the main character does not turn 'back good', he stays true to himself that he is not a good person and what he has done can't be undone or justified. I feel sorry for Jang Han seo because I really liked his character. He started to grow and be truly free of his abusive brother that's why I felt sorry for him but hey, it was his own decision to put a fight. Anyway, it has some comedy as well along the line but the same time it's a solid serious to watch.\",\n",
       "   \"It's a average korean novel, those who like korean cultural elements may like it, but it's not for me. Now, I'm not a newbie to korean shows and I know they can be a little silly. But silliness in this show is just too much. Poor acting by FL and ML both, specially FL. She just ruined every scene she was in.This definately doesn't deserve 8.5 ratings.\",\n",

This show has it all, gangsters/mafia, love drama, revenge, betrayals, comedy and a whole cast of amazing actors. Some I initially hated, grew on me so much that I am cheering for them. This show has one of the most intelligent writing I have ever seen displayed on a screen.

I am really satisfied with the drama. Its may 2 today and the last episode was aired today. I was really waiting for this episode as well as didn't wanted this drama to end, but as we all were anticipated for a great and happy ending. It was thrilling. This drama made me laugh, cry when Jang Han Seo died (I am angry with this one. I was crying for about half and hour😢) , made me feel better. I had the best experience of my life throughout these 20 episodes. I lived my life in this world with all of them. Anticipated for season 2.Kimaya,\\nA member of cassano family.\",\n",

It's a lovely series. It's over the top, sometimes exaggerated, the overacting is funny and just works. The serious moments are on point. The slow motion shots make me chuckle- Everything just works.Vincenzo Cassano in an Italian suit made me feel bad about myself.

All of the cast's acting are so good and entertaining.This is basically an action comedy series wrapped in the world of lawyers and mafia. Almost like those crime movies the people love but 100% more entertaining.The writing is genius, the plot is quite unpredictable. The crisis are well-developed, and the character's solutions for it are impressive - almost unthinkable.

Vincenzo contains a very absorbing plot, a cast star-struck by designer clothes, interspersed with Italian (and other) Classical music excerpts to set in relief some well written suspense and intrigue. The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo\\'s Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called \"hit\" US shows. So far, so good, Binjenzo!',\n",

Series starts off as though it is going to be an action movie, then turns a bit to a treasure hunt, then turns into a redemption movie, then comedy, then suspense-thriller and uh, even a bit of horror at one point lol. I have to say that probably in all the dramas I've ever watched, I have never quite felt such a broad mix of emotions in watching just ONE drama, but this is not a complaint at all. I seriously need to compliment the writers and director and actors/actresses for doing an amazing job mixing so many elements into one, and most importantly succeeding in the mix!Please make more dramas like Vincenzo! Truly a most enjoyable watch and this could probably be a textbook study for how to successfully mix many genres into one :PTo those with complaints on the silly/comedic parts of the show.. just enjoy it, real life is too serious as it is and its nice to have comic relief no?Oh, and interesting life lesson (though almost definitely unrealistic) from the latest episode I watched - being nice to pigeons could literally save your life one day =p.\",\n",
       "   'Vincenzo had an interesting start however when the main character goes back to Korea things start to get a bit silly....I think the first episodes when other characters are introduced are fine but later on a lot of time is wasted on the other building residents and honestly a lot of the times they don\\'t add much to the plot and every time they appeared forced jokes are shown and maybe because of the cultural differences that I might not get, so me personally didn\\'t find it funny at all.Also when they are on a trial everything is silly the acting of the actors like the judge and the main protagonist, so for me that kinda ruined this part of the trial episodes, I expected something a bit more serious...Honestly I found the brothers more interesting then the main characters, especially junwoo, I think his acting was the best out of everyone else, he showed different personas and face expressions in comparison with the main character Vincenzo that most of the time had a serious and cool image.The ending was fine kinda violent did not expected that due to the episodes being mostly \"comedic\".

       "   \"I wanted so much for this to be a 10 star rating after watching the first episode. I was complete blown away by Song Joong Ki's multilingual abilities in playing Vincenzo, the real Italian backdrop, the international mafia storyline. It really seemed all so promising.However, all this comes to a lukewarm plateau in the next few episodes, where Vincenzo ends up in South Korea and begins executing his mission of extracting gold from the basement of a rundown shopping plaza. It was heartwarming to see the him be reacquainted with the Korean life he had left behind as an orphaned child adopted by Italian foster parents, but I had already been sold on the hard mafia opening in the beginning.What was most disturbing for me was that the entire series opened with the scene of him bombing the shopping plaza where the gold was hidden, but in the end, this was never realized. I was really looking forward to see how he would manage convincing the residents of the plaza to move out so that he could destruct the plaza and extract the gold, but this was never realized.In fact, the entire plot became lost in a mushy romantic comedy between him and Jeon Yeo been's quirky yet lovable character Hong Cha Young, instead of the international action thriller it promised to be in the first episode. It became a story of how an Italian Korean reenacted his love for his countrymen, and how much his countrymen revered the Italian mafia, rather than a high intensity shootout or face off between him and his enemies with Italian mafia involvement on both sides to increase the tension.At the end of it, I felt not only lost but deceived. As much as I love the cast and the screenplay, it wasn't what it sold itself to be. It wasn't consistent, even though it was enjoyable for most parts.\",\n",

From how Vincenzo is introduced (I hate how unrealistic the fire spread though) to the schemes, how strong Babel is build as an unpenetratable image.. All could've been something more than this. Yet it might've been this brilliant style which killed the show.First of all: Everything was done perfectly right-on-time like a 2nd grade fomula. Yes good pacing can sometime do great, like how it hyped people's feelin when Joon Woo show off his identity (uwu gud stuff). But what's unforgivetable is how it breaks the beautiful setting that this show provided. We all know lucky moments and coincidences are sometime acceptable as it's reasonable to happen and will only make the scenes more awesome. But bruh not in this case, bc they freakin spammed it! The amount of oopsie moments that were created only for the shake of helping the protagonist and his companions are immesurable. Remember how Vincenzo and plaza owner closed the shelter's door right on time in ep ? Or when he arrive just b4 main girl of the show have her face punched? These little but ugly details totally ruined my experience as it's bland out unrealistic.Secondly: Weak character building followed up by weak script. Seriously, Paolo the gangster boss is nothing but a bullied child who dare do nothing, even can't take revenge on Vincenzo's driver when his master is abroad. And I was totally dissapointed seeing how Vincenzo easily kidnapped, tortured, got information from frankly any bad guys. It's like his aura of a normal build little baby face man and some weak measures of suffering could scare the f*ck out of everyone. Not to say no guard or security plan is effective against a korean mafia boy who works alone to invade Babel's domain and employees. Also, the poducers liked to spam backup saveboats that litterally turns the tide of the show. Oh Vincenzo is in trouble? Don't worry, he's rich and knows martial art at a superior rate! Oh plaza civilians are in danger? Don't care cause all of them know how to fight, and some are even masters of brawls. And you won't need me to speak out loud how trashy nerfed Ant Company was, right? (Although I hate it when the members of goverment and important people keep showing up to help willingly for no particular reason more)\\nHmm, at this rate I think further criticism is unnecessary as you may've all now capable of looking at that overrated mess called Binsenjo Cassanova with a more precise perspective. For me myself, well the only reason I watched it to the end is 'cause of Joon Woo's actin, plot and role (as it's acted brilliantly with some manners of being the most realisticccc and No.1 part of the whole show uwu)\\nBrrrr idk but if your taste is of not very high standard, this TV-series can still entertain you well...... to a certain level that is.\",\n",

Kwak Dong Yeon is one of my favourite actors from way back in \"Never Twice\" and \" Love in the Moonlight\". He is Jang Jun Woo\\'s brother in this series. It\\'s a big change of role from what I\\'ve seen him in and I was a bit shocked, he is scary at times, but excellent a tings. Kim Yeo Jin as Choi Jung Hee is scaring me to death, she is some badass Prosecutor, I hate her tactics in this role but she is some good actress. Now Vincenzo (Song Joon Ki), he\\'s so cool as Mafia Lawyer, I\\'ve only seen him in Decendants of the Sun, and didn\\'t leave much impression, but here he is rocking it. I\\'m impressed. I\\'m having such fun and laughter watching this, my dog runs out of the room when I Laugh too loud. I\\'m giving it 9 at this point, may come back to comment when I\\'ve watched the whole series.',\n",
       "   'When I read the summary of the show I was expecting a show which had elements of thriller, mystery, action and a well made mafia plot. But all I got was a wannabe mafia or legal drama which had comedy all over the place. It wasn\\'t even a proper mafia or legal drama as there were hardly any courtroom scenes or any real mafia elements. The writers dragged this show for way too many episodes and most of the times Vincenzo doesn\\'t even think like a consigliere who worked for the mafia. Even after so many attempts of accidents and killing, he doesn\\'t think that it\\'s wise to hire more amount of bodyguards for the people who are close to him. There are so many incidents which he could have avoided if he actually behaved like a consigliere. In the ending of episode 19 suddenly Vincenzo was dumb and weak. If you are a fangirl/fanboy of the lead character then you will love this show. But if you wanted to see a well made show like \"Vagabond\" then this convuluted mess isn\\'t for you. Don\\'t get me wrong, I enjoyed watching the show because of the geumga plaza people and their comedy, but I was expecting something serious. Still I am giving this show a 6 star, only because all the actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and the soundtrack was really good! The show could be even greater if it was done by the writers of \"Vagabond\".',\n",

No one could have played vincenzo better than Song joon ki. He's the best. Jeon yeo been is so good as Cha young. Their chemistry is so refreshing. The drama makes you hate the villian(jang ho seok) and at the same time makes you fall in love with actor (Ok taecyon) cuz he's so good at it. And everyone else as supporting characters are also out standing. You will fall in love with the Geugum plaza family. Finale will leave you overwhelmed. Totally recommended.\",\n",

Yet from that seemingly absurd mix comes a basic plotline that makes complete hash out of any lawyer show you have ever seen, mixes serious violence, mayhem and murder with humerous come-uppances to the bad guys, and has an undercover cop deciding that our hero isn\\'t Mafia at all--but a heroic version of Che Guevera? The first few episodes need a bit of time to shake out, but when they get going, it\\'s wonderful. Favorite scene to date--the corrupt judge who is stung by hornets in his classroom. I\\'m no good at remembering their names, but the female lead overdoes it a bit, particularly in the beginning. Vincenzo is terrific right from the beginning. Co-stars and regulars are also wonderful. The actors are all having great fun, and it shows. I hope there is room left at the end for another season-or 10.',\n",

The biggest hurdle for the liberal party is to break the tie between the major newspaper media, the conglomerates and the all powerful prosecutor's office that works for them.

       "   'Where do I begin? I was hooked from the start, yet I wanted to do justice to this show by submitting a holistic review only when all 20 episodes were aired. Do not jump to premature conclusions or dislikes, you will lose in the end.Vincenzo is an up-to-date cinematographic homage to Balzac\\'s Human Comedy and Dante\\'s Divine Comedy, depicting nowadays society and performing a yo-yo between black comedy, pure drama, surreal fiction, bitter satire and slow-burned, realistic romance. All packed beautifully courtesy to the talent, hard work, creativity and dedication of the cast and staff.Why 10 stars when there\\'s no perfection in this world? Because Vincenzo is enough and superb in its imperfections. Because it\\'s addictive and memorable. Because it will change something in you while watching it.The Director and Writer did a great job, hats off for their teamwork and mutual understanding upon what this drama stands for. It\\'s clear they had cohesion in the making of this drama. And they challenged the so often all-seen stereotypes and tropes some might expected to get in a Mafia show. The concept used and the mise-en-scene created a refreshing masterpiece!Each episode ends in style, with dramatic or unexpected cliffhangers that will keep you hooked like crazy, trying to guess what\\'s next. And in most cases you\\'ll fail to anticipate correctly.This show display meaningful character developments and human typologies. The chemistry between the cast was palpable and genuine. They were acting like a real team. It was the first time I watched the BTS of a movie/serial to understand how was that possible with such abundance of actors. The Geumga Plaza tenants it\\'s us, the society, for sure. Each is unique individually, powerless when separated, yet with impact when awaken and united, catalyzed around a higher scope than just miserly surviving.The villains were manny and diverse, in accordance with the saying \"the evil is prevalent and vehement\". The Mafia was a concept perfectly used to explain the evil presence and ugly realities like corruption, greed, criminality, betrayal and dehumanization. Yet, small acts of good and humanity here and there saves this drama from a mere nihilism message.The romantic side is discreet, like a footnote, presented meaningfully to contrast with the atrocities around. And being powerful and memorable against all ods thanks to the great and candid chemistry of leading actors. It\\'s the first time I am proud of how this feeling was portrayed between a man and a woman. No cheesy childish tropes, no toxic behaviour, vulgarity or skinship displayed, yet you know that longing and love is there come hell or high water. Also solid partnership, trust, respect and friendship is there, despite comic bickering. It\\'s the healthiest relationship between two lonely people that meet unexpectedly at the crossroads of a toxic, corrupt environment. Being an anti-hero or simply villains is a lonely job, that comes with personal losses and sacrifices. Remembering the stares between Vincenzo and Cha Young along the entire show, but mostly at the end of episode 20, those two pairs of eyes broke me. Makes you wonder what price are we willing to pay in order to stand for each other or f right what is wrong?The OST and BGM of this drama is so emotional and powerful, beyond all expectations! When associated with scenes from Vincenzo it becomes a powerhouse. I\\'m still listening to it, vividly.Memorable, mature lines and scenes will sink deep in your head and soul because of their innate relatability. You will also laugh like crazy while ordering a corn salad. You will start seeing pigeons in a different light. And the sound of someone toying with a lighter around you will inevitably make you feel that things are about to escalate.All in all, you will want to watch the show more than once, hoping for a season 2, sequel, spinoff or whatever crumbs of Vincenzo are possible. Yeah, first time to give 10 stars to a show, wholeheartedly!',\n",

But I really like the drama, even millions of people on earth feel the same as me.Weaknesses in this drama:\\nThere is one ep that seems, one scene being repeated tends to be boring and makes it difficult for the audience to digest the next story. However, because we were surprised by other actions, we were made to forget about those shortcomings for me.Second, Vincenzo is helped by Inzaghi and his friends. It really doesn't make sense, science actually exists. There is a sense of wonder and also strange in me.But if it can be corrected, Vincenzo should have been defeated at that point, it will make the audience feel disappointed and then more enthusiastic to watch it.There is no scine Vincenzo loses, as if the plot is very imposing the plot, to make the villain continue to be weak.

I don't think the posters or the trailer really can capture what duality this show has between the noir feeling at points vs. The truly absurd comedy, so it's confusing to tell what you're getting into, but by the time I hit episode 4 I started to realize that it was going to be a ride and by episode 10 I was just super invested in rooting for the characters.

This show had a lot of supporting roles but I was invested in every single character on this show. They were a lot, but it never felt crowded. Each character had a soul and identity and it showed throughout this show's 20 episode run.And lastly I want to highlight the outfits in the show! Everyone was SO classy! Especially, SJK and JYB! SJK served his looks in literally EVERY SCENE. Both his and JYBs outfits were on point all the time, I was constantly blown away because they looked so good!This show is almost perfect. I say almost (and the reason for my 0.5 point deduction) because I wish there were more fluff/romantic scenes between the two leads!!! After everything these characters went through (and because my thirsty inner-self craved it), I wanted to see more PG13/R action between V and HCY.

       "   'This is not a fan-friendly review. Although the series is not the best, it is a good series that several chapters can be rescued but not all. At first we are used to very long chapters, a bit empty, they have top moments that hook you but a thread is lost in the critical attention of those who see it. There are chapters that I consider to be really good like some initials and some endings, but 20 chapters are not necessary, chapters that if you skip, you will still understand the plot and you did not miss anything, clearly it is not a piece of art, because it does not have The best photograph is very long, there are characters that do not have nuances, such as the antagonist, who dehumanizes someone only to have feelings of evil, or to hook up with a character who practically only at the end realizes the love he feels for the girl , which we must question because at this point in history it is not healthy to continue having this type of concept about love as a couple. Now, there are chapters that are really good for the nuances of some characters, for the Korean humor, for the impeccability of the script, for the photography of some landscape scenes, for the costumes. But I insist that a maximum of 10 chapters would be good, not 20 because I feel that in addition to saying good, some are not so good but I already invested a considerable time I have to finish it to see the outcome that is anticipated in the acting of the characters from the initial chapters .The development of the relationship between the characters is seen throughout the story, but I question the way a character is idolized in this case a man in the role of savior. In short, it is not a bad criticism but a constructive and obvious one, I love this actor and many of his characters, I like many things about him as an actor and seeing many characters from other series that are still really incredible in their acting roles.',\n",

Cambyses tore the skin of a corrupt judge after his execution, not while he was alive.I know that even though he was dead, he should not have cut off his skin, which is wrong.But the author also did a terrible job and compared we Iranians to the Barbarians and He described us as savages and bloodthirsty people.

He will not kill her. Remember episode 1. No women and no kids. That's why Vincenzo doesn't respect Paolo. So, she survives but lives in fear.Maybe Hong Cha-young will do it in another episode or Jang Han Seok or Mr Han or Jang Han-Seo. It won't be Vincenzo.

       "   'I\\'ve watched Vincenzo until ep.18 (out of 20), so I guess it\\'s already acceptable for me to write a review. My feeling about this series : unfortunately, really really disappointed.The reason why I watched this series is because I was intrigued by the genre : a mixture between politic, thriller, action, and comedy. The first few episodes are quite fun. But that fun only last for approximately the first 10 episodes. Even in the first 10 episodes, I already found several issues that bothered me. For example, why is Cha-Young fighting against her dad in the first place? There\\'s no backstory whatsoever about why she chose to work in Woosang despite how corrupted Woosang is (only for the money? I dunno). Then, there\\'s Myung-Hee. What is her motive? What is the reason for her total support for Han-Seok despite their constant losing? Is she just downright \\'evil\\'? And for Han Seok, I just can\\'t believe the writer just explained his character as a psychopath. Don\\'t tell me that this is not a lazy way to create an antagonist character.What annoyed me the most is actually what she and Han Seok keep on doing every single episode : an empty threat \"You\\'ll regret it\", \"What if I kill you first?\" blah blah. Their method of winning is apparently : A doesn\\'t want to cooperate? Kill A. B knows something he/she shouldn\\'t? Kill B. C is acting annoying? Kill C.But of course Vincenzo will always outsmart them and win. If this only happens for like 2/3 episodes, I won\\'t be so annoyed. But this pattern of handsome-and-perfect main lead that keeps winning against the \\'bad guys\\', no matter how cliché it is (yes, Inzaghi, I see you), for every single episode, is just.. underwhelming.Han Seo is at least a more interesting character than Myung Hee or Han Seok. He shows change : once a shadow for his brother and was always afraid of him, but now finally has courage to fight against him and even becoming wittier.I mean, this series can be great, with a proper storyline. Probably a less perfect Vincenzo that can make mistakes sometimes. Probably a smarter and cunning antagonist that\\'s actually \\'do\\' something instead of just talking big and failed miserably..Don\\'t get me wrong, I love the actors and actress. They saved the show. They saved the poor and lazy story writing. That\\'s why I give the rating of 5 : despite the meh story writing, the CGI of Italy (and Inzaghi apparently) is beautiful and realistic, some of the comedic scene is quite funny, the cinematography is amazing, and the music they choose do compliments the atmosphere.But, in the end, nothing can really save a poor story.',\n",

Loved her quirkiness in the show.Im Chulsoo (Ahn Gi-Seok) is the most fun-loving supporting actor as an Intelligent Service Agent.Entire star cast has done amazing job and unfolding of every character of the show is just so beautiful. I have never liked Kwak Dong-heon (Jang Han-seo) in any dramas before, but he is very impressive in this show. Villains of the show actually makes us feel uuggghhhhhh.Despite of being a crime thriller show, the partnership and chemistry of lead actors is what makes the show MOST SPECIAL. So mature so breath-taking and realistic. Vincenzo being a Mafia is shown to be Cold hearted but has a heart of Gold in real. He cannot be in any relationship given the dangers that come along. Just for that reason her mother was killed after 30 years of reuniting with her. Cha-young understands this and somewhere down the line they come close and start being like a couple and Vincenzo does things to make her happy and protect her. The fake proposal act they had to do was Real to them in their hearts. Finally, when Vincenzo confesses the love in words and yet leave her again, she still understands it. Just a fictional show but the feelings the audience can feel is Real True and Deep.Show has 20 episode and not for once it felt dragged. Action sequences were really enjoyable especially whenever Vincenzo would hold Gun and of course the Lighter.Inzhagi the pigeon act was pure genius. So was the entire Gay act by both the involved cast. It was brilliantly executed.Joon-Ki's and Yeo-Been's Shaman act was the best portrayal of their Versatility in acting.Soundtracks/OST not to be missed. I am always by your side by John Park is the perfect song that describes Vincenzo Cha-young relationship. MESMERISING.The piano/hacker girl helped to retrieve gold and so did the Monks and they kept a share for themselves. I get it. But other plaza members also helped a lot and were sincere and deserving of some gold if not a lot. They called themselves as Cassano Family with the growing attachment to Vincenzo which he reciprocated. In Finale they show 'After 1 year' and I was really hoping the lives of family & the plaza to be a improved version but it wasn't so. Plaza members even came forward to help the piano girl twice when in danger, so felt unfair for other members to not have a share.Subtitles do not give 100% justice and satisfaction of the show.

Love this drama until Vincenzo was distracted by love and could not save the loyal Allie who saved him. That was the most disappointing part but other then that It was an amazing drama.',\n",
       "   \"I think the writer's initially had a good idea and the basic plot had potential but then the writer's tried to way too much (ie. Tried to appeal to everyone and ended up with a too long ridiculous, stupid, and silly drama that I found to get worse with every episode.) I did like the early episode and the main character and main villain, hence the 3 stars). I cannot recommend this drama and unlike other kdramas I would not feel sad if the building collapsed and killed all the characters (well maybe I would shed one tear for Vincenzo).\",\n",
       "   \"Extremely overrated show! Feels like the script was written by some 16 year old kid and was brought to execution! Extremely poor character development and super annoying Female lead!It seems the producers don't understand the meaning of black comedy, the comedic elements were way too overdone and turned out to be more lame and frustrating than anywhere close to being funny!It was seriously one of the worst KDramas that I have watched so far!

       "   'I\\'ve never been one to write reviews on movies or TV shows, but after just finishing Vincenzo, I can\\'t resist the urge to share my thoughts!This show has been such an amusement park and I loved every single second of it! I won\\'t spoil anything, but I\\'ll give my thought on some of the different aspects of the show.The story (10/10):This show grabbed a hold of me within the first minutes. The beginning really set the atmosphere and painted the main character as a cold, calculated and mysterious person. I mean; who does not like a beginning that glues you to the screen right away. I have to be honest and say that I binged the whole show in a week due to the never ending captivity of Vincenzo and the story that unfolds around him. I\\'m hope I\\'m not biased, but this show had me from start to finish and for that I have to give the story, a top rating.The characters: (10/10)\\nAs the show goes on, we get to know all the different characters, their personas, their believes and what their values are. All the characters are great and gives the show a perfect balance of excitement, comedy and sadness. I can honestly say that I was just as interested in Vincenzo as I was in the other characters. They all had their story unfold like a present thought out the show.The protagonists were great, the antagonists were very good and all the other side-characters were interesting. What more can you ask for?The music: (10/10)There is nothing more to say than \"Bellissimo!\" The music was used in a perfect manner, the choice of songs at certain moments were spot on and they really gave the show a good feeling of Italian and Korean. Much respect the the people who worked on the music for this show.This might seem like a very biased review, but I still can\\'t shake the feeling I\\'m left with, now that I\\'ve finished the show. I want to watch it again! I want to experience the opening sequence, I want to hear the music and I want to see how it ends all over again! Brilliant show! Just brilliant! If you haven\\'t watched it, then do it! I promise you won\\'t regret it. I laughed, I cringed, I cried and I enjoyed my way thought this masterpiece! I hope you will do the same.If you\\'ve read this far, then I thank you for reading my thoughts about this show. Leave a like if you enjoyed reading about my extravagant experience with Vincenzo!',\n",
       "   \"Absolutely engaging. To all those who got bored to early, I'd suggest you wait till episode 3/4, you'll be hooked.\",\n",
       "   \"Been watching kdrama from years and this show is the most over rated. The comedy is cringe. The people in the plaza are annoying. The male and female lead lack chemistry and their romance is awkward. Twists are silly. Over all 20 episodes is too much. I don't understand what's wrong with the users giving 10/10 just for the sake of increasing ratings. I couldn't go past episode 9, where I generally binge watch many kdrama.\",\n",

       "   'Characters are completely idiotic, mainly the female lead, and the main lead, Vincenzo. The rest of the side characters are just annoying plot fillers. They don\\'t contribute anything useful, just childish comedy no one finds funny. There are never really any stakes because of how thick the plot armor is so the \"tense music\" in scenes just gets more and more annoying every episode. Guns are often pointed just as a scare tactic, not really used, and it gets annoying really fast. Writers keep shying away from the actual plot because they know they don\\'t have the guts to make a good plot that remains strong and consistent. Too many slow motion scenes that just were awful to endure, not because they were heartfelt, but because they were unnecessary and just dragged the episode out. It felt like the writers were just coming up with something random left and right just to have 20 episodes. The plot was complicated at first but it soon came with a simple solution...with two thirds of the show still left to fill up with gags and cringeworthy moments instead of the characters actually solving the problem. I would have stopped watching this at probably the fourth episode but the only reason I watched the rest was because my cousin wanted to finish it with me. I recommend watching this if you want to waste your time. If you don\\'t, there are plenty of other crime/thrillers that you\\'ll find much more captivating out there.',\n",

Nothing really happens until episode 19. In some cases you end up rooting for the evil guy to win. It is a struggle between trying to be this \"serious\" crime drama and a comedy where reality doesn\\'t exist. Great actors but plot it too cheap.',\n",

I gave three stars because I like joong-ki and the cinematography of this series is superb.',\n",

And I had the biggest crush on Hong Cha-Yeong because she is just so amazing. She reminds me of Bae- Ro-Na for some reason and I love it. The villains did amazing & the story was chef's kiss. Definitely on my top 10.\",\n",

This drama is not a single genre dealing series so it have something for everyone. It\\'s a new treat for kdrama lovers. I don\\'t have words to explain how much song joong ki was good. There is no doubt in song joong ki\\'s hard work. I think he deserves a desang. And song joong ki\\'s proformance was brightened by others cast members. Vincenzo was titled by main character\\'s name but it would have been always incomplete without the other cast. Jeon yeo bin and song joong ki seems like made for each other. Taecyeon was brilliant.

Because mafia factions are at war with each other, he flees to South Korea, where he gets involved with lawyer Hong Cha Young. She is the type of attorney who will do anything to win a case.

Vincenzo is very powerfull man and you saw it..He has ability do whatever he says.

       "   \"I saw a lot of people critiquing the first four episodes for being misled about this being a neo-noir crime show. My expectation however was another K drama with a darker theme.This turned out to be it, while the the first few episodes are more comedic in nature, the following episodes get darker and darker. The finale rides the line of a straight up torture film. The action was top notch but some of the comedy was a bit cringey. It didn't help that all the 'funny' scenes were accompanied by goofy jingles.Although the main villain turned out to be a character with little backstory he was still very intimidating. The show made you feel very sorry for the protagonists and most of the time I actively hated the villains.Besides the comedy I thought that the show had a few other weak points; the romance and the subplot about the gold stashed under a temple. The weird thing is that I could feel some chemistry between Vincenzo and Hong but besides two kisses and a hug there was not much romance. They probably cut it short because the show already had so much plot. The gold subplot is weak because it goes on for too long and the characters act in bizarre ways.On a positive note the rest of the show was good including the music and cinematography. There are some scenes where character's deaths are portrayed in very creative ways.In terms of structure I am starting to notice a pattern in K-dramas: 1. Set up the story in 3-4 episodes 2. Spend about 10+ episodes stretching out the story with twists and turns. 3. Resolve the story in 4 episodes where one of the main characters gets injured. 4. do a finale where the characters get to say goodbye or stay together and kiss.Overall the show is a solid 8 out of 10.\",\n",

       " 'Law School': [['A group of students at a law school excel in learning the law and performing mock trials. All the students have issues which come to light and they become involved in cases of corruption and murder. The series is well acted and in parts absorbing and interesting but it does seem disjointed. There are parts of the story which just come to an abrupt end and there are too many subplots which have no real development and with less going on and more focus this series would have been better.',\n",
       "   \"Only was able to watch 3 episodes. And had to give up. Since I needed subtitles, the back and forth time lines(more than 2) is making me dizzy. This and the complexity of the law arguments that is needed to show off the students and their personalities, and the murky relationship setups.Now my mind is almost out of it. Not to mentioned the school politics. I get it, it's homage to Rashomon. But execution is a bit clunky, not focused. Complexity is not always about the number of items, can be about depth of a few.Or maybe is the styling of the show that's just not up my alley. Lighting is too bright, too even, camera works sometimes too tricky. Any everyone delivering their lines at the same pace.I don't doubt that this is a good series but better luck next time.\",\n",
       "   'The following is my brief with respect to this series. LS is, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty of being a supreme legal drama.Fantasy shows don\\'t appeal to everybody: Some prefer realistic dramas. There are many more that hate procedure, or predictability: They want to be surprised by a last minute, reluctant witness. This show should only satisfy one of these groups......perhaps it will of neither of them will favor it.This could almost be labeled a law school \"fantasy\" series, as unviable as that sounds. The web of lives, the condensed degrees of separation, and the tangle of grudges and motivations wouldn\\'t be admissible in a true-to-life drama. It is a strain to think of professors at an ivy league level school being as caring as the profs in this drama are. Identifying the right suspect is not as predictable as it is slightly erroneous. Astute viewers may still be able to pinpoint the killer with ease and declare it too predictable.... To which I say: \"Quash all of that. Who cares?\"LS is not guilty of contempt. They\\'ve put together a winning case.So, suspend your skepticism and examine all the evidence yourself. The jury most watch the whole show prior to deliberations, so we are remanded to get on the roller-coaster and enjoy LS.This show is written, directed, and edited, with a habile hand (I just looked \"habile\" up and decided to use it....pretty cool word, right? I hope it impresses the judge and jury).LS follows the lives of law school students and some of the professors, as well: Their struggles and triumphs, families, friends, and foes, and their growth as they navigate through the fraught chambers of their lauded institution.Prof Yang and Kang Sol A are fabulous characters. I could listen to Kim Myung-Min (Prof Yang) talk all day. His voice is divinely masculine and deep. It would have been tossed out if he couldn\\'t act, or take command of the courtroom, but he can, and very well ar that.The director sustains the tension throughout the series. It\\'s high mystery in classic form. The taut editing and soundtrack sequester the audience in a state of suspense. If you reason that you know who the culprit is in EP 3, you might waiver by EP 8. The evidence keeps our minds in motion, turning like a bottle being spun on a table.We should overrule some of their arguments, though. There are things that seem judiciously obvious to the court at large, that elude their brilliant minds. That always weighs a case down.I strongly object to the last moments of the show, which are remitted as way too brief. We get very little discovery pertaining to what the characters went on to do or what the relationship is of the three that are walking together at the end. It resounded like a cracked gavel. That may be heresay, however, the prosecution will argue that it\\'s pure negligence to wrap up a 16+ hour series with a 10 second consultation. Would that we could depose the director about that decision.However, we can easily dismiss any such torts committed by the director. Indubitably, the director\\'s curriculum vitae (resume) shows he\\'s had a solid run, and has high likeability factor. The overall quality of the piece is a mitigating factor taken into account in the sentencing phase: LS gets all the credit for time served, and remains released for all if us to enjoy.I originally postponed the hearing on LS as I wasn\\'t convinced that it would sway me. The worth of its collateral was evident once its docket came up on the calendar (my Netflix queue), and I sat in judgment. While I wasn\\'t confident of its appeal, now that all the exhibits have been examined, Res Ipsa Loquitor: The thing speaks for itself.In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this drama has acquitted itself laudably. The ratings prove what broad appeal it has. The preponderance of the evidence is that this show has prevailed in it\\'s effort to convince us of its credibility. So don\\'t waiver: Watch as an interested party. I\\'m sure you will agree to stipulate the worthiness of the production.IMHO...\\n🎬8 🤔8 🎭8.Suggested Age 12& up.',\n",

       "   'I was waiting something great when I saw the first two episodes. However, I was wrong. I was only bored after every single episode. Too much legal terminology, unrealistic characters , predictable plot twists and so many flashbacks with no reason.The only positive was the soundtrack and of course its ability to make me sleep like a little bird.',\n",
       "   'At first, i thought that this would just be like any other thriller drama where the first episode presents the characters and what this series is about. And finally, episode 2&3 will show a major secret villain. But nope, it got me wrong. Each episode will just make the viewer feeling gawk even more. And then when the OST \"it\\'s driving me crazy\" hits you\\'ll just go along because that is what this drama is.Only a small minus, the characters speak and subtitles, sometimes, are too fast. Great series overall.',\n",
       "   \"I would've loved to have been locked in with the storyliners when they decided how they were going to take the plot lines and weave them all together. Each of the characters' stories are relatively linear individually, but they are told in an interwoven and complex way due to people's lies and the hiding of truth.The viewer is asked consider their own perspective on things like copying other people's intellectual property, permissions granted or taken, the simple rules we break and the possible consequences of those, and whether or not we can ever truly know the world that generations outside of our own, live in. A number of the subplots ask you to consider the very human cost of judicial papertrails and decisions.The parallel premise of the teaching of what law means and how it ought to be used, and the way it actually exists in the real world, is masterfully presented by the lead actors. I recommend you watch the first two episodes together before you decide whether or not you're going to continue. I quite often waited until there were three episodes in a row available before I watched, as it was just too frustrating to have to wait for the next one!\",\n",

       "   'Can\\'t get enough of watching it once so I watch it twice😍 I can say that LAW SCHOOL is one of the BEST Korean drama and legal drama of all time. This is the very first time I write a review on a drama because I find it worthy of my review. It\\'s quite confusing at first because of the law jargons, but if you give attention to it you will be hooked and keep asking for more because every episode gets better and leave a hanging and intense ending. I think all questions and cases from the start to end has been solved but they don\\'t show it on detailed because they think of it unnecessary and can make the series more complex. And it is also a nature of Korean drama that they end the drama hanging. So, it\\'s just perfect for me! The storyline was quite amazing and mind-blowing because you can\\'t guess what will happen next. All actors did a great job in portraying their roles. Kim Bum\\'s acting is so lit! His so charming and natural.👏Of course the OST is also amazing because it fits well to the mood of the drama, kudos to the music team it give chills and goosebumps to the drama. Han Joon Hwi and Kang Sol A\\'s chemistry? Just perfect! Korean drama cliche? LAW SCHOOL doesn\\'t have it! It is more on \"new side of Korean drama\". This drama did a great job in giving and showing the viewers knowledge on law and justice. Another is, it gives a lesson to every student especially college students that no matter how you struggle in your course, you even think on quiting and giving up because you think you are not capable to it, don\\'t lose hope. Even though many people are dragging you down, there are also people who are willing to be on your side and help you until you succeed. Kudos to the whole law school team! A job well done! I am not asking for SEASON 2 because season 1 is just perfect for me, but if there is another season I will be rooting for it.🤞 I highly recommend this exceptional Korean drama! If you haven\\'t watch it, you\\'re missing a great masterpiece! 💚💚💚😇',\n",
       "   \"As a person who loves law related shows, i loved this drama, i binge watched all of it in a day. I think you will either love this drama or hate it, depending on your preference of plots. The storyline follows a professor of a popular law school being suspected of a murder of another professor, and his students help him get proven innocent. Of course there are side plots as well more little details, but i think it's better to watch the drama rather than reading about the side plots. Overall, i loved this drama and it's definitely in my top 10 kdramas list.\",\n",
       "   'Firstly i would like to state that this series is not a masterpiece in anyway however, it still keeps you hooked to it. After watching the first few episodes it gave me the vibe of the \"How to Get Away with Murder\" series which it heavily inspires from (this statement in no way claims that the series is a rip-off).The twist and turns in the episodes may sometime make u scratch your head as in \"what the hell is going on\" but trust me it is still watchable.',\n",

So basically this drama is about a murder of a person which takes place at a law school. Like everyone is a suspect the main point of the story is finding out who is the murder. I like every single character here prof yang junghoon gotta to be my fav character at first I had mixed feelings about him but as the episodes went on I started loving him more and more he is such a great character. I am telling u will enjoy it. Its still airing as of now I can't wait for the next few episodes to come out I am still in ep 8 but still so far I absolutely love it. Its my summer vacation as of now and this drama just made my vacation better. I will give u my review after I finished watching it fully.Now like what are u waiting for go watch it.\",\n",

       "   'To start with the less than ideal bits, there are moments in the show when the plot feels farfetched and a bit too convenient, and it certainly has its fair share of cliches. But towards the end, I found myself empathetic for the characters and was happy to see their lives turned out well. This was a pleasant surprise for me since I rarely get this invested in characters in a \"warm\" show like this.This brings me to the next point. There are great show/movies these days with deep/intriguing plots that make you invested, and shows/movies that are warm and just give you a good time. But these two categories are too often mutually exclusive of each other. In my opinion this show is a healthy blend of the two.Overall I\\'d recommend it if you enjoy good acting and entertaining plot and are okay with the few shortcomings I\\'ve mentioned above.',\n",

All the suspicion and the way the story has been delivered has expanded my very own imagination.I know the first episode was not delivered that well but beyond that has been a quite a enjoyable ride. And it is not as slow as it seems, your mind will be constantly engaged . And if you would be willing to cross the barrier of subtitles and biases against korean production then it will be a gem that you will find.

I love the feeling of fully anticipating for the next episode to come as it leaves us with more questions, rather than being confused. The OSTs and background music are no joke too. However, Law School is really underrated maybe because some thinks that it would be complicated as hell - which is actually not. Try watching until the 2nd episode and you will not get enough of this drama as it makes the 1st episode finally realistic. Trust me, I've watched until 9 and here I am craving for more 🙃\",\n",

       "   'After a long time, I\\'ve witnessed one of the most naturalistic shows on Television! \"Law School\" went beyond my expectation level. It has this amazing quality of making the audience stick to their seats the entire time. The cast, their dialogue delivery and expression - everything is top-notch. The lead roles - Kim Bum, Ryu Hye-young and Kim Myung-min are outstanding, and the way they wrapped up the show is what I call a \"PURE CLASS\"! And you\\'ll get the vibe ever time the OST hits. It\\'s addictive!This series speaks about the law, the justice and the judiciary system...as well as its ups and downs and complexity. There will be always multiple strings within the system, and it is inevitable. But at the end of the day, justice should be served at any cost no matter how long it takes - and Law School does not hesitate to imply that fact.For me the most intriguing part is, despite being a high-school drama, Law School does not deliver any extra sugarcoating romance or cheesy scenes like the other Netflix shows. You will come across the regular student life, the pressure and struggle that we all have gone through in our lives. That\\'s where it connects the dots with us.Now that it has ended, I hate to acknowledge that I will miss this show terribly. I loved every one of them, and maybe I will take this memory to my grave too.',\n",

       "   'I loved this series. Many of the law school bits are accurate to legal studies. I do think the series could have ended after 11 episodes and been very strong. It dragged on for a bit. But I did enjoy how the episodes looked back in time at the histories of the characters, who I grew to love.',\n",
       "   \"I was beginning to lose interest in this nearly halfway through ep4, because - thanks to the absolute brilliant editing - it was starting to feel too obvious, the 'whodunnit', for what is supposed to be a 16-episode law-school-based mystery. But that sucker punch of a twist that is -(again, brilliant editing)- juxtaposed with certain reasoning exposition, JUST WOW.Will I revisit this review when I'm done with this series to rewrite it into a complete comprehensive one to the best of my ability? Dunno. Maybe. We'll see. 😁\",\n",

Each character has their own story blending in with the events of story being prominent. My only disappointment is that when Netflix handling of the ending. They originally stated that the next episode would be in \"X\" amount of days and then all of a sudden there were no more episodes. WTF Netflix?',\n",

       " 'Geu Hae Urineun': [['Korean Drama \"Our Beloved Summer\" is a slice of life love story that founds its success in the lingering feelings between two exs who have to work together after a long time.The drama does a great job creating the perfect atmosphere, with the use of lighting being on point, the scenes were beautifully shot and executed and the OST was brilliantly selected. And true, the game between the two main characters was an intriguing one, with the yearning for them to be back together being the force prompting the interesting factor. However, when that one was taken out of the equation, the drama got tiring and lots of scenes were added that were unnecessary and only there to fill in. So, yes, the drama started pretty strong, but it got predictable and boring towards the end. It also left out the family situation of the main lead out, which was a plotline that could have been explored in more depth.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast, which was consisted of an all-star pallette.So, overall, 7 out of 10.',\n",
       "   'K-drama yang mengulas cinta pertama di bangku SMA hingga kesempatan kedua di dunia kerja dengan pendekatan beda. Kim Yoon-jin sukses menerapkan konsep dokumenter dalam film, alhasil kesan raw dan realistisnya sulit ditampik apalagi didukung skenario apik.Kekuatan lain yaitu performa Kim Da-mi dan Choi Woo-shik yang berhasil menjelaskan pahit manisnya cinta lewat tahapan coming-of-age yang juga believable. Chemistry mereka mampu memantik emosi penonton tanpa berlebihan. Sajian musim semi dan kesempatan kedua yang terekam sempurna sambil menghadirkan elemen nostalgia.',\n",
       "   \"A romance drama about two grown adults who had their documentary shoot 10 years ago and relationship thereafter, which ended eventually. After 10 years, it happens once again and yes it feels nostalgic in every way.The best thing about Our Beloved Summer that catches the eye is the cast. The charms of Kim Dami and Choi Woo Shik, who radiate youthful energy, fill up the screen, and the chemistry between the two naturally leads the story. The drama emphasizes the images of summer and thanks to this, the play's overall atmosphere is full of freshness. Also it might feel relatable to many viewers' teenage life they lived.The cast, whether be the lead or the supporting, had a great connection. The soundtrack is soothing and melodious which fits the setting of the drama. The story had depth, but it was fairly executed, if not efficiently. Also the supporting characters weren't given much exposure as one would have thought. Although it doesn't come close to other feel-good romance drama (like Hometown Cha Cha or When The Weather Is Fine), Our Beloved Summer manages to hold itself through freshness and nostalgic moments of reminiscing the good old teenage life.To summarise, Our Beloved Summer ends itself as a dama that conveys the sweetness of love and the freshness of youth at the same time. It's effective enough to catch viewers' attention with it's fair, if not excellent story and screenplay.My Rating : 6.5/10.\",\n",
       "   'A documentary film is made of two students, one being the best in school the other being the worst. Years later a catch up is filmed and we see if there is still a spark as they separated with animosity after the first show. A heart warming drama with excellent leads and a good supporting cast which looks at how we develop as individuals and how the right people meet at the wrong time. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the series I think the stories with the supporting cast should have been fleshed out as I felt some of them were just glossed over and I was interested in them as characters but felt shortchanged.',\n",
       "   'On the surface, \"Our Beloved Summer\" is about two unlikely high school students who are paired together for a documentary. Yeon-Soo is the top student in her class. She\\'s driven and determined to be the best. At the other end of the spectrum is Choi-Woong, who is dead last in his class. He appears to be lazy, uninterested, and lacking in any ambition.On a much deeper level, \"Our Beloved Summer\" is about the pain we all carry around with us. Much of it has to do with the past and how people are treated, whether it be from parents, other friends, or people from relationships. Pain is inevitable. Suffering, however, is optional. And it\\'s amazing how much we suffer by holding on to the past. Yeon-Soo bitterly states in one episode, \"Facing the past makes me feel trapped in it.\" This is because the past needs to be released. Especially the pain. And much of this series is about that: letting go of the pain, and thus, coming to peace with the past.Yeon-Soo is a woman who appears confident and doesn\\'t seem to care what anyone thinks about her. This makes her appear cold and indifferent. However, this is what is on the surface, because underneath, she\\'s a young woman in turmoil. She pushes everyone away from her because she feels she not worthy of being liked or loved by anyone. The irony of pushing people away in order to avoid pain, is that the person we really end up hurting, is ourselves.Choi-Woong is similar in his pain. However, instead of pushing others away, Woong chooses to barricade himself in his house, focusing on his art, and having little contact with others. Why? Because he\\'s been abandoned by those that should have loved him and been there for him. And so, just like Yeon-Soo, he also feels unworthy. And when Yeon-Soo breaks up with him the first time, it reinforces his feelings of unworthiness all the more. Woong is also a gifted artist. However, he draws only buildings, which seem to mirror his own feelings of trying to maintain emotionless and distant from anyone else. We come to find that is true masterpiece of art is finally revealed in the very last episode!Ten years later, Yeon-Soo and Choi-Woong are asked to do another documentary, due to the success of the first one. Reluctantly, they agree. However, the more they begin to spend time together, they not only realize that the feelings they had for each other never went away, but they\\'re able to finally confront their own demons from their past and put them to rest. They do this by acknowledging their fears and realizing what\\'s been holding them back. They also realize that the goal of a relationship isn\\'t to change the other person, but to change yourself. And this is why their relationship ultimately works.The world is full of Yeon-Soos and Choi-Woongs. People who build up defensive walls, or hide themselves away because they believe what others have told them: that they are unworthy. Feelings of unworthiness truly rob us of our chance of having a happy, fulfilling life. And they exist only within our own minds.This series is truly beautiful and uplifting in depicting the pain of these two lovable characters and watch their healing finally begin to take place. What\\'s more, is that they also learn how to lean on each other when needed. They begin to trust their own love and strength and use it for each other as well as for themselves.I cannot speak highly enough of Kim Mi-Da and Choi Woo-Shik. Not only is their chemistry undeniable, but they are able to give us deep, complex characters using subtlety as a powerful acting tool. A look; a smile; a falling tear...all brilliantly showcased to make us feel every emotion that they are conveying.I was also thankful that the writers didn\\'t succumb to a \"typical\" ending in the last episode. I love it when writers dare to follow a more realistic path that suits the characters and the situation rather than force a \"happy ending\" that is contrived and unbelievable.I rarely speak of the music in my reviews, but Kim Kyung Hee has quickly become a favorite of mine! His title song is something that I\\'ve found myslef playing over and over again. I also loved his songs from \"Crash Landing On You.\" He seems to perfectly capture Yeon-Soo and Choi-Woong in his song. I can\\'t listen to it and not think of them!This is one of my all-time favorite series involving \"young\" love. I cannot say enough about it. The series was cute, funny, heart-breaking, inspiring, touching, provocative, necessary, and deep. How many series can I say that about in over 45 years of watching shows? Not many.',\n",
       "   \"I really enjoyed this and there wasn't a dull moment in the show. The pacing was good and this was so easy to watch. The story flowed really well and I felt like each episode finished too quickly - a result of good writing honestly. Amazing performances by the entire cast and especially by Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi, they breathed life into the show and had incredible chemistry with each other. The soundtrack in this show was amazing too, they evoked so much emotion from the viewer.\",\n",
       "   \"This drama cannot be boiled down as just a romance drama.At its very core,its a drama about how people deal with loneliness and the feeling of abandonment and simple human emotions. Everything about this drama feels so human. They all grew from the people they were at the beginning. Their progression felt so natural. That is the beauty of the drama, it takes simple human emotions and presents them so vulnerably that we all can relate to some part of it.It is very well directed and written. The cinematography is exceptionally beautiful. It's very hard to find a drama like this where everything just seems to fall into place naturally. I find it to be so comforting,like a warm hug.\",\n",
       "   'Our beloved summer.Was love at first side,but ended with a blunder.My pride and ego got in the way.And I had nothing more to say.Just give me a second chance if I can stay?!This is nu poem about this serie. Like if you agree?',\n",
       "   'TBH, I was debating whether or not to watch it (slow-paced romance isn\\'t my cup of tea), but when I heard V singing Christmas tree, I told myself I should, and I didn\\'t regret it at all. The story is AMAZING. I\\'m not saying there are many plot twists and such, but it keeps you interested. The directing and writing are both AMAZING. It is always a difficult task to tell the past and present at the same time. The balance between those two timelines was excellent. The pace of the drama, in my opinion, was slow. However, with a good storyline, I can overlook that fact.I love the character design for Kook Yeon Soo and Choi Ung. They were unique yet relatable. The drama involves us so much with the characters that you slowly start to understand their POV, decisions, habits, etc. You start to live the characters. The conflict between the main two leads is so great. It\\'s like the saying OPPOSITE ATTRACT. They both are extremely different but it\\'s heartwarming to see them keeping their differences aside and embracing each other as they are. I liked the documentary that played a big role. Also, it helped me understand how two people can have different memories and perspectives of the same moment.Don\\'t even get me started on second lead Ji Ung. I felt sorry for him. I can badly relate to him. He had a difficult childhood and yearned for love and family. But, as they say, all\\'s well that ends well. I like how they wrapped it up with all of the art pieces together.Overall, Our beloved summer is full of romance, heartbreak, patch-ups, and levity. The new love story will make you feel butterflies, while the sad moments will make you cry. In the end, it was a great adventure for me! And I wholeheartedly recommend this drama.PS: Tae\\'s voice has the ability to amplify emotions. When the OST \"Christmas Tree\" played in the background, the entire scene became more romantic and emotional.',\n",
       "   \"I love the aesthetic of this series. The camerawork is great. The acting and casting is really good too. This series had many very deep and genuine scenes, which I really liked. I also really liked the side characters' stories, I think I even liked their stories better. For me, there was just something missing from the main characters' story. I don't know if it was the lack of chemistry or something else, but I wasn't really drawn to their story. Other than that, it was still a decent show.\",\n",
       "   'This show tells us that as long as we are alive we can be happy no matter what, we can forgive, we can try, and we can love.Main Characters were just so good...they had their own struggles, they had their own way to deal with their pasts and they dont want to make the other one suffer. That\\'s what makes them special.The chemistry of both the leads are incredible. Choi Woo Shik looked soooo damn cute and Kim DaMi looked perfect with him.I just loved the pacing and how the story progressed. I am a sucker for slow-paced drama. A slow-paced drama can actually heal you and teach you a lot of things and this drama did it for me!The best thing I like about this drama is that the writers did not delve too much into every character\\'s past but dealt with it in enough detail to give us context.Not a single character in this drama made me feel horrible. All the characters had their own purpose and they fit in perfectly. It was just a perfect 10 on 10.The character developments were perfect for every character. Like literally every single character was developed by itself by the end of the drama and I loved it!Also I will take this opportunity to praise Park Jinjoo again, cause she is a Queen and always nails her roles. She makes the drama more watchable and funny.I can truly say that this is the best rom-com for me this year I have enjoyed this beautiful series to my heart content. I laughed and cried throughout the drama had my heart broken and fluttered in the same episode itself. Hometown Cha Cha Cha and Our beloved Summer..on the same table for me.All the \\'couples\\' here are just so love(i do not have the word to describe them really).OST, epilogue, every detail was perfect!!PS: Tae\\'s voice can magnify your emotions.Whenever the OST \"Christmas Tree\" was playing in the background, it made the whole scenes more romantic and emotional.',\n",
       "   \"Let's start by saying that the cinematography is just amazing, the colors and the shots were perfectly in harmony with the plot and the characters. Good choice of the main actors, they really have an amazing chemistry and their characters are very well developed, they will make you fall in love with their story. Each episode consider the different points of view of the characters so that everything always make sense.They will warm your heart (I need Choi Ung to be my boyfriend is so caring and perfect). You'll also cry a little or a lot but it's all worth it!\",\n",
       "   \"I watched this show from start to finish as it was airing to keep up with the trends. I enjoy Twitter discourse on kdrama tv shows and this one was getting a lot of buzz. However I frequently found myself having absolutely nothing to say at the end of each episode. To be fair, they did a great job evening the playing field after starting the show with characters who have already broken each other's hearts. It can be tough to rebuild a relationship when the audience already is biased towards one partner. However, the pairing wasn't my problem. These two are great together (though I preferred them both in the Witch) and are fun enough. But all the side characters could've been removed and the story would be no different. All the characters besides the main couple had no life and no understandable motivations. I didn't even care for how any of their storylines wrapped up in the last episode cause I was just happy it was over. I like slice of life dramas but every character should be fleshed out as much as the main ones. It was boring to be frank. I don't see the hype. I really feel like I'm missing something that people find special about this drama.\",\n",
       "   \"PROS: The poster of the two actors looking disappointed and helpless was what attracted me to this drama. After watching it, it was confirmed that the two lead actors did a great job portraying Choi Ung and Kook Yeon-Su. Their quick-paced jibes at each other were funny, but their shyness towards and tenderness for one another was moving at the same time.Another actor who deserves praise is Lee Joon-Huyk as the arrogant but astute Jang Do-Yul. His character was well-written, used effectively to create tension and humour whenever it was needed.CONS: NJ, played by Roh Jeong-Eui, became an unnecessary character about 1/3 way through. Her storyline of all the bullying and unfair treatment that she got as an idol singer has nothing to do with the main storyline of Choi Ung and Kook Yeon-Su's romance. When the story made it clear that NJ was no competition for Choi Ung's affections, her character should have been written off the script just like Jang Do Yul's had been. The continued focus on her irrelevant storyline was simply annoying by the end. NJ is the reason why I'm giving this drama an 8 and not a 9 or 10.\",\n",
       "   \"Words can't express how much I really love this show. It talks so much about real life stresses but it's also very lighthearted and funny. Wooshik and Dami really did a great job and I love them both as actors so much. Would 1000000% watch this over and over.\",\n",
       "   'It is a good drama. But there are better ones. And watching the drama and seeing a 8.6 rating, i don\\'t think compatible. Here is why: don\\'t evokes emotion with the script, it\\'s repetitive (especially when they stop bringing the couple\\'s past which was kind of funny and curious to watch), not only the story is repetitive, but the action of the characters and they waste good characters... Anyways, good points: beautiful cinematography, great actors, good start. It\\'s what I describe as familiar and confortoble, but sometimes it\\'s just too long, too empty and makes me feel indifferent. I would not recommend to anyone. It deserves some credit. However not so much. Go watch \"twenty five, twenty one\", if you want something meaningful, toching, warm and with nice rhythm that it is going to keep you interested.',\n",
       "   \"This is one of the best summer romance drama.It is All time favourite for me.I like the whole script, setting , characters, main leads' acting.Production design also great ! Main leads have strong chemistry between them !!\",\n",
       "   'Everyone did a good job in this second chance romantic drama, but it felt like there was a lot of filler, repetition and padding out. The secondary characters were wasted but there was genuine poignancy in the pain and burdens that the three leads carried.Prefer Kim Dami being edgy than the vanilla version we got here but if you came for Choi Woo Shik he delivers with every gorgeous smile, perfect outfit and criminally long eyelashes. Continue to watch his career with great scholarly interest.',\n",
       "   \"I enjoyed the first several episodes, but then it started to drag on A LOT. The only character development was the male MC. While I empathized with the female MC at times, I found her incredibly frustrating because she treated her bf like absolute garbage for no reason. She came across as emotionally manipulative and it seemed like 5 years later, she never really grew up and loved to belittle Ung. I also didn't even get a sense of her personality - it was bland tbh.I actually really loved NJ and Lee Sol Yi, though.And lastly, I actually don't think Kook and Ung should have ended up together in the end.\",\n",
       "   'I stopped watching kdrams since the story lines and plots were dragging in almost every kdrama i watched . But this one is so fresh and unique concept , the heroine is not a clumsy shy person instead she can make decisions for herself properly . No stupid antagonist timeline and no stupid parents drama . The only great thing was it was focused solely on the love story between the two main characters, side stories were not dragged and were purposeful . Every character was well written and executed by the actors . Its a must watch ! If you are sick of the stupid lame story lines , then this one is for you !',\n",

Episodes start to pick up towards episode 6 and becomes more interesting when the characters start to interact more with each other. Kim Da-mi's best performance is still in Itaewon Class.Episode 16 finale felt a bit rushed and stitched together. Overall, series is worth a watch as there are some feel good moments. Also, the OST is amazing.\",\n",
       "   \"Totally my view and my opinion, Ung's manager, NJ, the female lead's friend, the jokes and the meaningless funny scens and vibes they make, seriously ruining the show, I love meaningful scenes such the producer's scenes, with his friends, mom, and Ung's parents and even his junior are kind of the best scenes, maybe I'm not in the mode for comedy but really the unnecessary comedy scenes and characters are so unnecessary.Well the main leads are absolutely magnificent.\",\n",

       "   \"Our Beloved Summer is so beautiful and heartwarming. It might not be filled with action and agony towards the solving of a mystery, but it holds a lot of agony within how each character will heal their hearts, grow up emotionally, and reach their happiness. That is a complex thing that takes time, and proper communication, so it's very real in that sense because it portrays exactly that. It doesn't romanticise toxicity, or build unrealistic standards making it appear like an old fairy tale. Because of those reasons, it's a very beautiful and mature show, without being heavy in any way. Anyone that enjoys heartwarming shows filled with raw emotion and genuine real relationships of kind souls will enjoy Our Beloved Summer. I recommend it, without a single doubt.\",\n",
       "   \"I really enjoyed the 1st episode. Kim Da-Mi is the cutest. I loved her performance in Itaewon Class.Can't wait for more episodes, it wish they released all episodes at once, but I have to wait for weekly episodes now, but it's satisfying in a different way to wait for episodes every week. I'll have something to look forward to.\",\n",
       "   \"And I'm very critical when it comes to Korean Dramas for some reason! But this one managed to tick all of the boxes. It's very warm, cute and comforting, it leaves feeling good and content.This drama managed to avoid all my major pet beeves; the over the top acting, the cringe dialogue and pointless plots. It wasn't trying too hard to be something, instead it was so believable. The writers did an amazing job, it's not really telling a story that haven't been told before or anything, but the execution was PERFECT. Huge kudos to the cast as well! Woo Shik is one of my favorite actors! I loved everything I've seen him in! Can't wait to see where he goes from here. Also, the documentary theme was so intriguing right from the start, I was invested immediately.The fact that my least favorite trop is love triangles, yet I loved this drama so freaking much, even-though a love triangle was a big part of the plot, says a lot!!! Again, it's the execution! You understand these characters, you feel for them and you see where they're coming from.And it's not just a love story, even-though it's the main plot. Each character is dealing with something on their own, and that gives them so much depth.The final episode was perfect. It made me so emotional, because you are not sure how it's going to end up really. The writers keep you on the edge of your seat. I cried few times, it was just so touching, moving and so damn beautiful.\",\n",

Choi Woo Shik really is a naturally talented actor and their chemistry with Kim Da Mi is just amazing. Everything about them; their lives, relationship feels so real.

I also watched The Witch:Part 1. The Subversion ,a thrilling action film. The film is great, and they work together for the first time and get to know each other because of the film. According to their interview,they have been friends ever since. That's one of the reasons why they act in this play --'our beloved summer'.

But, since it almost 11 years, means half of my life enjoying to criticize a movie and drama. I can see their bright future in this entertainment. They seems a fresh look, for a future actor and actress. They act so well and i love how they potrait the character so natural. Even, their chemistry give a natural and comfortable way to look. This drama is so unic too, looks simple yet so meaningfull. I can see the plot twist in Choi Woong character, how Yeon Su fight for life and other cast give a good impact. The rom-com and youth genre is a right choice for them. The director pick a great cast!! I really appreciated them for real. Sorry for my bad english, I hope u guys enjoy and appreciated this drama very well too❤.I want to give a credit to tingfied from asian wiki fans who wrote abt this review,\\n\"The storyline and writing are also really great so far - I love how the plot has been progressing each week and how we slowly get to piece the full story by seeing everyone\\'s different POV. I really think the way they structure the episodes is super cool and unique - a mix of documentary, flashbacks, present moment, different POV, etc. The cinematography is also great!\"',\n",
       "   \"This is so good, it makes me waiting for the new episodes every monday. The actors are so talented as well. I think it can be the best drama in 2021.every single episode can't make me getting bored, maybe i get addicted to this drama.\",\n",
       "   \"Our beloved summer looks like a cliché at first, but the more you watch, the more you see that it's a deep psychological/emotional analysis of a couple pre/during/post break up, and the interactions between the cast behind and on screen are so wholesome! The scenery is WOW. The filming/cinematography/editing deserves so much appreciation. It's so much more cinematic than the usual K-drama. The color grading and lighting are perfect. Each setting and time represents a season, and, of course, there are the beautiful OSTs like Drawer by 10cm and Christmas Tree by V of BTS. It's simple yet complex and detailed at the same time. I'm loving it so much and am eagerly waiting for each episode!\",\n",
       "   \"I've been a Kdrama addict for a while; Our Beloved Summer is no doubt the finest production since The Coffee Prince. And that is a long time coming.As perfect as a kdrama script can be; there are things that are obviously out of place. The writer portrait the male lead to be the quiet under-achiever that can comfortably recites Nietzsche's theme of Eternal Return; somehow the same person would fail to see the economic hardship that his partner has been enduring for 5 years. Did he tried helping? He's either stupid or he didn't care. For that, I gave this 9/10.\",\n",
       "   \"This movie is like a cure for heartache. It is gentle, profound and empathetic. Besides the love story of the two main characters, it is also the story of each character line in the film, in everyone's heart contains an unnamed sadness that cannot be shared with anyone. Reality is not always easy.\",\n",
       "   \"Though most of the episodes may bring down tears, the acting of all the characters were portrayed so well. Emotions were deeply immersed by the actors themselves and I was so impressed!It has been a long time since I was hooked to a romance kdrama. The last time I got hooked was actually Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo! Little did I know I would be in love again with another pair's chemistry (Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi) <3Cinematography and OSTs are just chef's kiss. I really like how they used the concept of the seasons to show how their love changed as they grew older. It's just so beautiful and I was reminded of the lessons I learned from dating my first love hahaha.The storyline was very realistic as well. It showed how important honest and open communication is in making a relationship last. I remember my first love wouldn't be open to me, and since I was young, I wasn't patient enough to wait. However, as the years passed by, I noticed each character's development and I am so amazed! No one is toxic either, in fact, they all deserve a happy ending!Because of this kdrama, I was able to learn so much about what loving a person is truly like. It's not the superficial things such as looks or money, but accepting the person fully despite the flaws. I also learned about the different love languages and how important it is to inform your partner about it.Thank you for such a refreshing and well-written kdrama :) I am hoping for a new project where Kim Da Mi and Choi Woo Shik work together again. They have superb acting skills and talent.\",\n",
       "   'Relying on the trailer, it appears that this will be similar to those teen dramas. However, as the episodes progress, you become engrossed in the characters as well as the plot, the transitions of each character, and the significance of those around them. This drama reminds me to always appreciate what I have and to be grateful for the little things in life. Yeon Su\\'s line really compelled me, \"We are the only ones who make our lives pathetic.\"',\n",
       "   'In was, first time you laughed. Middle part your crumb to dilemma and sad. Ending you would be big smile, fluttering, and happy. Your emotions would be bumpy.',\n",
       "   'I\\'m compelled to write this review because I believe everyone should watch this series. However, if you\\'re new to Korean drama, don\\'t start with Our Beloved Summer, there are a lot of high quality KD, but OBS is on a league of its own and it sets the bar high.STORY:\\nHow can a simple story be told in such an exquisite work of art? The writer, Lee Na Eun, had a vision and trusted a rookie director, Kim Yoon Jin, to execute. No details were spared, from the cell phones used in the life stages of the characters, the books borrowed from the library when they were in HS, then as adults, and during the proposal. The place where they broke up and where Ungi said the magic words to Younsoo. I would be remiss if I didn\\'t mention the beautiful cinematography of \"Our Beloved Summer\". The series showcased the beauty of each of the four seasons.ACTING/CAST:\\nChoi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi are exceptional actors and their chemistry in OBS is un-matched. We can see why their co-star, Kim Sung Chul, referred to it as a national treasure. Choi Ung and Yeon Soo\\'s characters are typical of any Korean dramas and so is their story. What set them apart were the actors who played them, give all the awards to Wooshk and Dami now. They weren\\'t even on my radar prior to OBS, I watched IC but didn\\'t care for Dami then; and decided to watch Parasite in between OBS episodes.OST:\\nThe music of \"Our Beloved Summer\" pulled everything together. The story, the characters, each setting, each scene, were all made more beautiful because of the soundtrack. This is the first OST that I purchased, and I had to pay more for shipping than the actual products - I can\\'t wait!REWATCH VALUE:\\nI rewatched most episodes while waiting for new ones to be released. I\\'m planning on rewatching the entire series, with less anxiety of how it will end, and more appreciation of its artful storytelling.',\n",
       "   \"This drama is a very realistic love story drama from the point of view of all the actors, a story that you will find and feel in everyday life. Kook yeonsoo and choi ung are told like a couple who heal each other's wounds. Very beautiful from the storyline, ost and cinematography.\",\n",
       "   'Maybe some ppl will think the plot is really slow, but this is actually show how human feelings that are tugging. How they started falling in love, break up, the second meeting again, started to missing each other, try to against their own ego, and finally confess their feeling to each other.',\n",
       "   \"Funny how armys in the are saying they use taehyung when it's literally the artist decision whether they choose the project or not, afterall obs is still the most watched netflix korean tv series.\",\n",
       "   \"I am the type that nit-picks shows I would watch. I dislike wasting my time on dramas that would not pique my interest and stimulate my emotions consistently; and if I don't think that the casts have chemistry or suitable for their characters. My mood towards any series has a short rebound rate so I either skip clips and episodes or I abruptly drop them off forever.Before I even started watching Our Beloved Summer, I already held Choi Woo Shik & Kim Da Mi in high regard for their chemistry and acting skills. I kept watching their interaction in The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion. Thus, I had high expectation of this romcom drama and they did not fail me! When I saw the first episode, it gave me back the same feelings when I used to watch Princess Hours, Goblin, Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok- Joo, It's Okay Not To Be Okay, and Start-Up (Some of the K-Dramas I like that are top-tier).Despite not being in relationship since birth and never being in a break-up situation, I could still overwhelmingly relate to the story. The tension going on between Choi Ung And Yeonsu, the mishaps of life on one of the characters that caused traumatic experience to the both of them and the backstory, their POVs, their extremely cute knick-knacks, and the character development are straight masterpieces. The transition and the presentation of the four seasons in the progress of the male and female protagonists' relationship was insanely and carefully established so that the viewers would immensely grasp and feel the moment that everyone has been waiting for- just halfway through the ending. However, this series is far from just being a feel-good show. It still contains realistic hardships that every couples in real life could be going through, but I hope lessons would still be imparted 'til the last episode.Nevertheless, I have been in a rollercoaster of emotions because of what's going on this K-drama and because I'm trying to be patient waiting for the episodes. Thus I am speechless, how this series has only been gaining more support internationally than in South Korea. I wanted to understand why foreign viewers would become an avid patronage of such outstanding drama, but not the locals. I think Koreans like those dark- themed shows that tends to become overly stressful to watch.\",\n",
       "   \"I like the drama so far, the first episode is so cute, beautiful OSTs and great cast! Looking forward to the upcoming episodes. It's been a while since I watched romantic comedy dramas so this one looks promising.\",\n",
       "   \"What i like the most from our beloved summer is they don't have unnecessary lines or scenes which sometimes would make a drama feel prolonged. I realizes this around episode 14 and somehow it felt refreshing (maybe it's just me tho)\\nOverall very enjoyable drama those heartfelt scenes really warm your heart!Happy watching!!\"],\n",

       " 'Seulgiroun Euisasaenghal': [['\" Hospital Playlist \" is one of the hyped dramas of 2020 and you are going to like it if you loved dramas like Reply 1988. However, even though there are not many reviews that are not praising this drama, Hospital Playlist is not for everyone.The drama keeps a slow tempo, with the story being spread throughout the drama, probably so it can serve the next two seasons coming up next. Maybe that\\'s when the drama picks up. And yes, this is a slice of life, but, at times, it felt like there was nothing to look forward to in the next episode. Also, there were moments when the drama got boring too.That said, they did handle the romance masterfully, as to not overshadow the friendship and so that it didn\\'t become the main focus of the drama. They did a good job with the blend of music and story too, as well as with the flashbacks of their old days.Finally, when it comes to performances, the drama of course had excellent ones, as the cast was consisted by the best of the best.So, overall, six and a half out of ten, because there were some nice moments to the drama, but it felt like there was no story to it.',\n",
       "   'Brilliant and beautiful; sweet and wonderful. Strongly recommended, and cannot wait for the next seasons with this fabulous cast, director, and writer. What a treat.',\n",
       "   'IMDB has incorrectly combined two seasons into 24 eps when they are very different seasons. Season was is excellent, and I gave a 10. Season two is often silly and tedious and forced me to lower the score since IMDB combined them.',\n",
       "   'At the time of writing this review the U.K. is hopefully coming out of the total coved 19 lockdown, in which for the last 3 months once a week we have applauded our essential workers like doctors and nurses. This series although a romanticised version of events in a hospital reminds us of the life and death situations health professionals are met with daily. The show is well acted and the stars really sound like actual doctors with their varying bedside manners. Season one has a few romances blossoming with others about to bloom or die. The main protagonists are all musically adept and meet up once a week to jam which leaves each episode with a catchy song at the end. Would recommend watching for a feel good factor and if I could I would give it 8.5',\n",
       "   'There have been a number of \"hospital shows\" over the years. And yet, with so many, Hospital Playlist is unique. Why? Because it sticks with its strengths: chemistry between the five leads and staying away from the typical hospital politics.Instead, Hospital Playlist is about people. It\\'s about how we, as people, can endeavor to treat others just a little bit better; to put ourselves in the other person\\'s shoes rather than resort to snap judgments. If you remember Patch Adams, you\\'ll find that--for these five doctors at Yuji Medical Center--the people matter more than the disease or injury. In other words, it no longer pays to be indifferent and to block out natural emotions.Hospital Playlist is actually a fairly light show. Yes, it has some tense moments, but overall, it never gets bogged down in melodrama. Instead, it relies upon the unique chemistry of the five doctors who\\'ve known each other since medical school. And once a month, they get together and sing a song. Hence, the Hospital Playlist.Each doctor specializes in a certain field. First we have Ik-Jun, who is a general surgeon but specializes in the liver and liver transplants. He\\'s the lead singer of the group, and in many ways, he\\'s the glue of the group. He\\'s the first to crack a joke or do something humorous to lighten the tension. And Jung-Suk Jo is masterful at this! He\\'s got as much talent for comedy as he does for singing. He never takes things too seriously. His job is important, but treating his staff and his patients with respect is always of utmost importance to him.Next we have. Song Hwa who is a neurosurgeon. She\\'s kind, dedicated, and a bit of a workaholic. HIlariously enough, she\\'s someone who THINKS she can sing, but she can\\'t. Actress Jeon Mi Do is actually a professional singer, so to see her purposely sing out of tune is impressive.Seok Hung is the somewhat aloof but dedicated gynecologist in obstetrics. He\\'s every bit as caring about his patients and staff even though it\\'s not always obvious.Jun Wan is the brilliant cardiologist who can appear cold but to characterize him this way would be a disservice. Underneath the tough exterior is a man with a heart who believes that hard work and dedication is a key to success.Last, but certainly not least, we have Jeon Wong Ahn, the professor of pediatrics. Nurses and parents alike adore him for his unique way of handling children. He relates with them. He talks with them, and he never sees them as just another patient.There are many touching and heartfelt moments throughout the series as we journey along with them through the days, weeks, months, and even years. Don\\'t be surprised if you find yourself shedding a few tears one moment and then roaring out loud with laughter in the next. That\\'s the Hospital Playlist. In the end, it provides comfort. It provides hope that people can still treat each other with respect, with compassion, and with empathy.If you\\'re a music lover, you\\'ll find a cache of great songs, all sung and performed by the characters. At the end of each episode of Hospital Playlist, we are reminded not to take life so seriously. We\\'re reminded that life is supposed to be joyous and fun.At some point, I will definitely want to re-watch this great series. So, if you\\'re looking for something that is light, with many feel-good moments, as well as many hilarious ones, I\\'m sure you love Hospital Playlist!',\n",
       "   \"The most I can give is 8/10 but the reality is only 7.5/10. The very early episodes have no band play singing wasting time, later episodes became too much. Their music instrument skills are so fake and lousy except the lead male is still average. In Season 2, some episodes showed their lousy and fake music skills again.It is all about hospital doctors' lives, mostly only revealing the good ones and little about the real-life bad ones. Actually, this is not really reality but only showed the 2-4% type of doctors' lives. Overall, they dare not reveal the truth of doctors' lives and no doctors will willing to do so.Season 1 end of episodes did not have any conclusion ending at all so It is kind of bad directorship and production. The rest time between Season 1 and 2 is very apart. However the ending is in Season 2 so why they named it Season 2 and not still in Season 1? Why the time frame apart?Overall this drama is not exciting and not really like those Medical dramas. This is like more suitable and the likes of adult ladies dramas which is smooth, draggy, home-like,....\\nI think the high ratings are due to these grandma and house-wives likings.\",\n",
       "   'Grey\\'s Anatomy, Take Your Scalpel & Go Home, Now. K-Band-Aid is In The HOWSE-pitalI put off watching this highly rated show for a while because I found the name unappealing. Well, what\\'s in a name?This series follows 5 friends from college that eventually end up working at the same hospital in Seoul. Now that they are all back in Seoul, they resurrect their college band by working on 1 song a month, to ensure they take time to be together. Whether the above pre-screening sounds like a solid basis for a hospital drama or not, it\\'s merely the setting. What matters is the relationships, particularly as embodied in the writer/director/actors. In any case, HP has stitched together an outstanding fellowship of talent.Believe the hype: Watch it. HP is 🎧AWE🎤SOME🎉.HP is about friendship first, but also caring+respect for others, love, parents & children, music, and lots and lots of #food. The hospital scenes, including staff dynamics and operating room procedures, feel realistic. The characters are a delight.Here\\'s a shout-out to Jo Jung-Suk. He delivers another slam dunk with his performance as Dr. Lee Ik-jun. Every one does a great job.This just pertains to season 1. I haven\\'t started season 2 yet.(((((((()))))))))With season 2 now watched, the diagnosis is that their practice in season 1 rendered season 2 even #more affective. It continues with the uplifting treatment of the subjects, and it\\'s a resounding hit. Picking up right where it left off, there\\'s a seamless connection to season 1.Early in season 2 there\\'s a Ping-Pong tourney. Cardio-Thoracic Sx was looking good - until they had to concede in order to respond to an emergency. At least half of the matches seemed to be decided that way. Instead of mic drops, we see paddle drops. We get to hear other docs gossip about the great Lee Ik-jun: \\'I heard Dr Lee was in the Ping-Pong Club in college. In fact, I heard he was in EVERY club in college. He was even in the magic club.\\' Comfortably confident, Ik-jun tells Song-hwa: \"I\\'ll return victorious before this tea gets cold.\" (Nope. Nuclear Medicine runs the tables). His defeat is commemorated with these words: \"Tasting Defeat and savoring victory: These are the things that allow us to grow.\"Let\\'s take a moment to review the primary protagonists.In season 2, Lee Ik-jun continues to play Dr Cupid. While Ju-wan (the cardiologist) is worried about Ik-jun discovering whom he\\'s dating. We must wonder: Why worry? How could Ik-jun deny anybody love? Watch to see. He has time to play cupid, and also cover for the lunch lady because he\\'s so brilliant that everything is easy for him. Besides, he\\'s friends with the lunch lady on social media, and her son had a parole hearing. The only thing that takes Ik-jun more time than other docs, is walking thru the hospital. That\\'s because the highly loquacious Ik-jun is friends with everybody - security guards, aids, custodians, scattered guardians ... Just everybody.Ah, the unparalleled and misnamed SONG-hwa. She can do everything: neurosurgery, research, office visits, lectures,,, one of her biggest timetakers is her mentoring of any and all residents in their educational, professional, and even personal lives. She can do everything but sing. She sings anyway, with masses of verve. She gets pleasure out of little things, like rain. She dances at church and eats like a Sumo wrestler. Utterly delightful, she\\'s the heartbeat of the gang, excepting the band.Seok-hyung lost a little weight and he looks great in season 2. He declined to take over his father\\'s business and continues to rise to near celebrity populatiy as an Ob/Gyn, despite his modest and somewhat shy persona. Patients respond to his gentle and caring manner. One office visit depicts amazing ultrasound footage of a 10 week old fetus wiggling its arms and legs. The couple\\'s reaction is precious. Still focused on Seok-hyung, his mother remains unable to resist attempts to try to control him. She wants grandchildren. Now. She tells him: I don\\'t care who it is. Just get married.Dr. Chu continues to try and insert herself into Seok-hyung\\'s life. In season 2 he\\'s neither encouraging nor rejecting her efforts. Dr. Chu is not easily daunted. In fact, she\\'s downright inspirational. Openly perusing Seok-hyung, she often makes him laugh. Dr. Chu runs into Seok-hyung\\'s mother - literally. Mom was so offended that she even told Rosa she doesn\\'t care whom Seok-hyung marries, as long as it isn\\'t #HER!, speaking of Dr. Chu.Ju-wan is unchanged in season 2, and his relationship with Dr. Do, whom he is training, continues to improve. We get to meet Dr. Do\\'s wife in season 2.The pediatrician, Dr. Ahn (Andrea/Jeong-won) treads the course set in season 1. There\\'s not a lot to say w/o spoiling some surprises. He complains that his siblings are worried about mom, but as they can\\'t help \"right now\", they bombard him with calls. In rich irony he laments: \"Why did they enter the church, really?\"We see the return of almost all the side characters: Parents, siblings, other doctors, residents, as well as new first years. They all continue to round out the show well.Uju wants to go camping, so Ik-jun finally leaves his beloved city life for a weekend, because his son is his world. Hmmm. Who else loves camping?Gy-eol is looking relaxed and even pretty, especially with her hair down. We learn more about her in season 2.As a side note, there\\'s a realistic basis for the show. The positive connection between surgeons and music has actually been studied. The participants currently playing a musical instrument, at the time of the study, performed the laparoscopic tasks significantly faster than those who did not. They determined that visuo-spatial abilities used in laparoscopic performance clearly may be enhanced for individuals playing a musical instrument. It seems obvious that finger strength and dexterity should also be positively affected.Even though HP is a top-ten show\\nin all of Korea\\'s history, there are currently no plans for a season 3. The writer has completed the originally scripted storyline. That is the current status, but there\\'s actually numerous ways to continue the drama. For now, it\\'s a wrap. If you are one that dreads waiting for another season as it it\\'s a multistage invasive treatment plan, it\\'s safe to go forward with the HP procedure now, and hope for a reoccurance in the future.IMHO...\\n🎬9 🤔8 🎭9 ⚡4 💓8 🦋5 🎵 9 🎨6🔚9.Suggested Age 12& up, with a caveat: One unmarried couple is shown in bed together with enough skin showing to infer what\\'s unmistakably been going on. Any parents who object to that, be advised. The counter-balance is the realistic medical setting, along with reinforcement of good character.',\n",

I was happy when they were happy and sad when they were sad. Not that they showed it. These characters were so strong, impactful, and genuinely good people.The drama felt great overall. Especially the Season 1, which I think was close to perfect. The two stars were removed for Season 2.The stories are light but makes you look at the doctors in a more humane ways. They too have lives. While most are paid well, the effort and sacrifices they make for patients are usually gone unnoticed in daily lives. Here in this drama it focuses on especially that. So, instead of diagnosing the sickness and giving treatment, the drama focus on what happens before and after that. How the journey of a medical student is when he become an intern, to a resident to a professor.How doctors react when they lose patients, how they react when they can save lives, how to break news to patients family, how to balance work and life... its all heart warming and real.The season 2 was a bit draggy and focused unnecessarily on a single couple that got together in season 1. They hardly had any story and any screen time with them together was very boring and felt like fan service.Because of them the other stories that could have been more interesting were pushed into latter episodes and were done hurriedly. So, the finale was very lackluster.That is my only complain for the drama. However, season 1 was perfect!So, I will always recommend watching this!',\n",

       "   'I think it\\'s 7.5 for the first season, and 9 for the second one! I wish they would tell more about each main character, but since this is about hospital life so no wonder they also try to explore different story for the supporting characters including the patients. As a \"non-medical\" person, it\\'s a bit confusing to understand all the jargons. I binged watching the first season, and surprisingly I found it a bit boring because of the slow pace and too many medical jargons which I wasn\\'t interested at all. But in the second season, I think I\\'ve fallen in love with the main characters. I love the friendship between all the characters, and the way how they support and be there for each other. Well, to me, the most interesting part is about the background and life lesson behind each story, it\\'s just very very heartwarming. The romance between the characters is just enough but not too much. And for the last part, I love the soundtrack from the first season more. Oh I just love it!',\n",
       "   'This is one of the few TV shows I can wholeheartedly give a 10 rating. I love this series, watched twice the first season and going on the second season.The friendship depicted in this series is so heartwarming, not just for the 5 main casts but also their interaction and kindness towards their interns, fellows & nurses. Even the long lasting friendship between Rosa and the Director of the medical centre is just so warm - a friendship spans for 65 years and still going strong!The characters\\' development is another success, we grew to love all the cast (even the supporting roles) bits by bits through their actions, interaction with each other/other characters. Each episode provides us a good life lessons focusing on human behavior and emotions, the happiness when love one is healed, sadness when love one passed and the pain in between waiting for miracles to happen. It really pulled my heartstring. It motivated me to become a better person, be kind and more attentive to my family, friends and be more compassionate/empathy to strangers who are in need.I love all the actors and actresses; they all give very good performance. The child actor is so cute and the music is simply superb. One lovely thing about this series is the romance is not cheesy, because we all know Korean shows tend to get OTT cheesy when it comes to romance, and we do not have any super \"bad\" people, we see people of different characters/behavior, all with their own flaws but aren\\'t we all have flaws?Overall, I highly recommend this series to anyone.',\n",
       "   \"Friendship. Love. Life. Death. Music.Not your usual medical drama. I laughed, cried, sang, and danced. Superb screenplay!

       "   'A few of the reviewers seem to be turned off by the fact that there is no \"central \" storyline but i would argue that there is no central dramatic storyline is the very thing that appeals to me about the show. It is a story about an enduring friendship and the everyday lives of those in a hospital told with humor and compassion. There is beauty and love and tears and laughter and triumphs and failures to be found in all of our daily lives. What is wrong with trying to capture that in a drama? I really enjoy the ensemble acting and the mini-stories in each episode. I hope to be treated with as much compassion as these doctors show if I ever find myself in a hospital needing surgery.',\n",

But this is good if we make it as weekly series than daily series especially for binge-watch. I think the effort of this series is so big. Even before it's produced, the scriptwriter needs much time for research.\",\n",

       "   \"This is a very classy Korean drama. That much is evident in the cast and the writing. It's a skillful weave combining the mundane in a medic's life with the challenges. We see strong, invincible characters save a life but then something else in their narrative has them dying on the inside.None of the characters are successfully married. Either their relationships didn't work out, never matured, or were never realised but the details of such are incidental to the storyline rather the principal angst. This adds to the perception, perhaps, that not much occurs and yet each episode has a distinct dilemma. The doctor who yearns to be a priest, the romeo who may have found a true love too late, the doting single father who knows the unattainable one that would make his family complete.Personally, as a middle-aged London viewer I don't care for the 'Patridge Family' musical element which is pretty cheesy and surprising given that the drama works hard NOT to be cheesy, but I appreciate this is maybe something to tide over the k-pop teen viewers.Overall, I'd give an 8 but at times for writing and performances it really does hit a ten.\",\n",
       "   'Hospital playlist has moved to my top 5 medical series. Love the enduring friendship of the 5 main doctors. Like the main cast, each one perfect for their roles. Like the band and their music choices. Like the main supporting cast, and the patients and families living healthy issues, pregnancies, and traumas feel true to life. Really enjoyed every episode! All I can say is Season 3...Season 3...Season 3!!',\n",

Unlike the other medical drama which usually go for dramatic, suspenseful and depressing tone, this drama went for a light, musical feel. It's a success. This show hits all the right notes with its ensemble cast of musical actors, best direction and great script. So what if the series has no specific theme to it? How will it be different from other kdramas then? The series derives its distinct identity in this only.. It tells several mini stories through the eyes of these 5 characters. Loved their musical jamming. I felt envious that I never got to make such a gang of friends. Can't wait to see season 2. Shin won ho has done it again. Exceeded all expectations.. After all he has given us the Reply series, and Prison Playbook. Aloha... 😘😍\",\n",

Honestly, I cannot finish saying all of the sides for which everyone must watch this drama.\\nI just want to say: \"I am genuinely glad that this drama has been made & I feel happy for the fact that I did not ignore the drama rather I have watched this beautiful unique drama!\"\\nWhoever is watching my review, please do watch this drama.

       "   'Another masterpiece by director of Reply 1988. It will take a couple of episodes to get full grasp of this wonderful series. Life-saving doctors, attractive residents, budding romance, old romance, FOOD. It has all in it.',\n",
       "   'Hospital Playlist has been written by the same writer who wrote \"Reply 1988\", Lee Woo-jung. The producer is also the same, Shin Won-ho. The work that this combination creates is absolutely fantastic. Hospital Playlist shares a lot of the same vibe of \"Reply 1988\".Hospital Playlist does not have a central storyline. Instead, we see the storylines of the 5 main characters, who are all medical doctors in the same hospital, friends, and also musical band mates. There are plenty of smaller subplots that stretch out over multiple episodes, be sure not to miss those. And do not miss the easter eggs or cameos that the creators added that refer to \"Reply 1988\". This TV drama requires some attention span in the beginning, but once you are suck in their worlds, you will share their heartwarming joy and heartbreaking tears.Like Reply 1988, we have a group of 5 friends: 4 guys, 1 girl. We get a look in their lives. It is very realistic and funny. All the cast is sublime and excellent. They bring their characters to life in such a wonderful way. Each episode you get a very welcome musical intermezzo near the end when the 5 friends come together to play a song live as a band. The songs they play are older Korean power ballads with strong lyrics that capture perfectly the main feeling of each episode. And there is a running gag of the female neurosurgeon Chae Song-hwa, played wonderfully by Jeon Mi-do, who is tone deaf and does not have a feeling of rhythm, but still wants to be a vocalist. It makes you smile from ear to ear.I absolutely enjoyed Hospital Playlist, season 1. It is such a wonderful TV drama that is heartwarming and heartbreaking. You get to laugh and to cry. Definitely recommended, get started and watch it!',\n",
       "   \"Typical medical soap drama in form of the Korean culture. Typical heavy sponsors thru out the series with the likes of Mercedes, McDonald's, some egg sandwich brand... And typical state of the art Samsungs.It's a pity though this was filmed during the Covid-19 pandemic that they did not bother to incorporate it to the series - instead it's all sunshine and rainbows where the main cast of the 5 doctors are hailed as gods who can solve any medical provlems throughout the series.Watch if - you're a fan of typical k drama with all the cutsie saranghae and all the bubbly women and handsome men.Don't bother if - you're not a fan typical k drama nor medical drama. Refreshing is definitely not the word to use for this series.\",\n",

       "   \"Well....after Reply 1988,Prison Playbook....they did it again!!! Another fantastic drama about friendship,love,relations and most importantly, story of lives. Kudos to the writer,director,Actors and the whole team!!!The thing i loved the most about this drama is,they didn't show the doctors as superhuman. Doctors are human too,they have their limitations, they have personal lives,struggles,emotions. They can't cure the patients with magic. They also fail sometimes. Its just reality. This thing is portrayed to well in this drama.Another thing i loved the most,a hospital is not only about doctors and patients. There are so many layers of characters and emotions attached with a hospital. There are fellow doctors, interns,nurses,stuffs,patients family,doctors family..... Everyone has their own story,own struggle. I loved how they at least tried to show some layers of it...and they did it beautifully!Actors did their job really well. I specially wanna appreciate Mi Do aka Song Hwan for playing the role of a tone deaf singer while being a musical actress in real life...a real tough job i must say!!I would really love if there was a season 3...but right now I'm really happy with two seasons...its like a warm hug you really need at this crucial time we are going through.\",\n",

No dramatic twist, no political treachery and no characters to be hated. Simply, it showcased empathy rather than an individual's story. It made you smile, laugh, cries, and surely will miss your friends especially these pandemic situations.For the first episode, you might be confused about the characters and faces because there are so many casts; Doctors, Nurses, Interns, and others. But as the story progresses you can identify them and you'll be impressed how well the story lined up from the hospital to playlist. This drama gives you a warm touch with morals and lessons that are taught throughout the 12 episodes.Bravo to the main cast because they lived their characters impressively. Each portrayal has its own unique factors and differences. I love their music, their band, and bonding. I love this medical drama, and I can't wait for season 2 hopefully by next year.\",\n",

In over fifty years in the work force I have never come across a mob like these.Given that there are some interesting storylines in this series it is a shame you don't know what time slot you are as it continuously weaves back and forth in time\\nWhat happened to continuity.It almost seems as though the writer/director got the whole script in a loose leaf pile then threw it out of a moving train.\",\n",

If you want to see 5 friends hang out, play music, and talk about nothing and the storyline not have any drive or hook then go ahead and watch this.

       "   \"When we see Yoo Yeon-Seok in this series, one would think of Dr. Romantic. But the similarity stops there. Anyone who's expecting an exaggerated, overly-dramatic plot like Dr. Romantic will be disappointed watching this. Yet, I love this drama - simply for its ability to weave simple narratives into beautiful episodes every week.It goes against any stereotype of love, hospital melodrama, and friendships - and gives you a strong vision of what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like in any aspect. As there are 5 main characters instead of 1, it really is trying to tell us 'we are not the center of attention' - everyone is their own main character. The dramatic events may happen in another room, but the characters themselves are enriching enough that they can hold their own story.It also reflects very healthy and strong friendships. Not every gal and guy that come together must have a romance - platonic friendships can develop and last. Not everything must have an underlying meaning.Finally, I like that there is no 'THE' bad guy. That's the thing about this drama - there are no stereotypes, no bad vs good. It's about living out our lives to the fullest, and enjoying the community around us.Sounds lame? Well, that might say more of ourselves than about the show - how we thrive for excitement in dramatic things but miss out on the beauty and humour in everyday life.\",\n",

There's something about the way he uses his eyes that allows few words to be spoken yet the intensity of his emotions can be felt.Kim Tae-ri does well too, but needs to tone down her theatrical gestures and speaking.

I feel like combing or cutting it every time she's in the scene.I love the story and the message its conveying, the hardships, determination, being understanding to others in their lowest days.

       " 'Itaewon Keullasseu': [[\"Itaewon class is a fresh and modern take on the revenge melodrama that is entertaining from start to finish. For people who have been put off by the serious heavy going revenge melodramas of the past like Money Flower and Shark and Green Rose, it's time to give the genre another chance. This has some feel good moments along the way with the building up of the business and the first take down of the villain. This is an ensemble effort with quite a lot of emphasis on the supporting cast of characters. There is a slight slow down in pace in the last 2 episodes but I understand its is to give some gravity to the climax of the show where he finds the meaning of his life. The kneeling is a bit excessive though.\\nThere are some groundbreaking things in this drama that handled quite tastefully and well without being preachy although the message is strong. Racism and stereotypes are shown with a half Korean half African character. He is quite funny. Also an actress plays a boy who transgenders to a girl. The romance is also unconventional. The original love interest played by Kwon Nara is made to seem unlikeable but in the end pulls through for him and has a consolation prize of Park Bo Gum. This is a breakout role for Kim Da Mi as a fearless smart young woman. I like the way they fell in love after all she did for him. Those looking for a sweet romance with lots of lovey dovey scenes would be disappointed. But they would not have been in place here anyway. After all this is a revenge drama - not a rom com. Some have pointed out a lack of chemistry and it does seem they are more like good friends but this isn't an old fashioned show so it's a different kind of love story. Park Seo Joon does the principled good guy well. Wish they could have varied the silly chestnut haircut at least for some of the show. The villain is well played by Ahn Bo Hyun. Kim Dong Hee is quite good as the younger brother. The OST is good too - not intrusive.\",\n",
       "   'So I basically decided to watch the whole kdrama on Netflix since I wasn\\'t able to find the Webtoon anywhere. However I\\'m glad I did watch the drama since the webtoon pretty much had the blandest art I\\'ve ever seen ngl (no offence to the artist btw). The colours and the scenery man are just stunning like seeing the breathtaking views of Seoul day and night just blows you away!I was really enjoying nearly all the characters. It was even unique that it added in transgender character who really needed more screen time to be honest. Lee Joo Young did such a nice performance as the character! I really wanted to see more of her character and Ryu Kyung Soo\\'s character together! The character I obviously couldn\\'t stand is Jang Geun Soo who always simping over Yiseo and just turns his back on Park Saeroyi a few times. He is like a \"damsel in distress\" character like for effin sake man, wipe off from the story jeez! Btw the actor who plays him is cute tho, I\\'ll give him that lol! To add, it\\'s also good to see an African man join the group too, I like the fact we have a kdrama representing diversity woop woop!!I gotta admit the whole thing took the whole day to finish it so the length to finishing it is ridiculous. Fair warning to all who have busy lives! I really enjoyed it though like it is worth the binge! It\\'s emotional, funny, gorgeous, tense, nearly everything you do or don\\'t expect in a romance drama depending how you look at it! Just watch kg guys, it\\'s a decent kshow to check out if you don\\'t want to read the Webtoon!',\n",
       "   '\" Itaewon Class \" had a strong start but it didn\\'t keep up with the momentum.The main problem with the drama was the pace. The skipping forward years in the future prevented the characters from having any character development and it just didn\\'t help the romance at all. Especially the 14th episode was just bad, as it felt like they were trying to present the current situation of the characters in a fast and furious way, editing scene after scene and just blurting out that the main character now loves this girl, out of the blue, but that\\'s that. No explanation was provided for their actions, no background and those four years in the future seemed like they four empty years (I mean even the flashbacks that the male lead was experiencing were from four years ago or of the same day, like nothing happened in those four years). Another factor that didn\\'t really help with the love story was that the couple didn\\'t have chemistry. They didn\\'t have any solid heart-racing moment either. So, them getting together was just too random and forceful.Finally, the characters remained the same as they were presented at the beginning of the drama. We knew the bad guys were bad and that didn\\'t really change, although, the son did have some potential to demonstrate why he was the monster he turned out to be, a potential that was never really properly explored. The big boss and enemy of the male lead felt also more like a promise of a bad character after all. He sure was mean to the main character and seriously unlikable, but, in the end, his actions were left in the behind the scenes grey area. The main character, in addition, showed zero development. He even got a bit boring after a while and felt a bit too bland in others.Now, for the good part of the drama. The beginning was just perfect. If you like melodrama, like I do, where the main character hits bottom and gets unfairly treated in order to stand up to his own two feet again and take matters into his own hands, then you are going to love the first half of the drama. The revenge plot was very satisfying as well, with a solid ending that was nicely presented. Though, it would have been nice if they showed how they actually managed to succeed, as the first part of the drama had focused on the struggles of them setting off. Another part of the drama that was pretty good was the characters. The members of the crew were unique and the drama didn\\'t shy off from issues like racism and gender identity. So, it was refreshing to see those elements added in the plot. The female leads were delightful too. They were strong women, the one beautiful but a tragic character, and the other young, fearless, reckless and somehow, likable. Sure, she did some questionable things, but she was young and just too full of herself, so it was nice to see how the others helped her realize that her attitude wasn\\'t always right and to grow up. I\\'ve also seen some other viewers not really liking her looks. Sure, she isn\\'t the classic beauty, but, for her character, who was cool and interesting, I think she was just perfect. Finally, the OST was solid.So, overall, six out of ten.',\n",
       "   'You have Principle? Please watch this if you believe u are one of the kind. You must echo this drama definitely. The romance line is also charming In this drama but the revenge part is the core. Sadly the ending not good enough and too many flash back to make story longer. The first 9 ep I rate 9 but last 7 drag to 5 only. But the concept of a principle young man just make me feel who will do this in reality... probably none. Interesting to watch at the beginning.',\n",
       "   \"Review By Kamal KItaewon Class was an emotional ride with an especially promising start. Just after the first two episodes, I felt immensely attached to the main character, Park Saeroyi, and was looking forward to following him on his journey. Throughout the 16 episodes, I definitely learned a lot from his hardwork and values. Park Seo Joon did a phenomenal job with his character and left me in absolute awe. Whether it may be understanding the beauty of life or being reminded the importance of hardwork; I was thankful to be able to get to know and learn from Park Saeroyi.However, apart from Park Saeroyi, I did have a few complaints for the other characters. Some characters were especially annoying, and lacked development. I did like that the drama showcased imperfect characters, but it also sometimes excused the ignorant behaviour of these characters - almost making it seem that such behaviour was appropriate to viewers. Some characters were especially inconsistent, and just seemed random. This switch was really annoying to see because it didn't make sense. I think these characters had a lot of potential to really compliment the story, but the writer just changed them randomly in order to make Park Saeroyi look good. I wish the side characters had contributed a little more to the overall plot but unfortunately we were unable to see that as viewers.I was disappointed with the last two episodes as I felt that there were unnecessary additions to the plot. However, the ending was still quite nice and most questions were answered.The OSTs were beautiful, and I know I will play them countless times in the future!Overall, this was definitely a meaningful and enjoyable watch.\",\n",
       "   'I was really impressed with the acting and pace until the last 2 episodes when I felt it lost its way, I have also preferred a different ending with the love triangle too. Overall worth a watch but I believe a lot of reviewers who gave it 10 wished they had watched the entire series before being so generous.',\n",
       "   \"Finished with the 6 available episodes and have to say this one is different than any KD I've seen, at first it got my attention and was interesting figured it would fad out somewhat like most but it builds with every show not that predictable plenty of surprises some good humor but not a romcom.Its a 10 so far nothing more i can as for a KD,give it at least 4 episodes and the claws come out after that men and women.\\nThrough episode 11 now and nobody can screw up a great series and a good mood like Korean writers, come on people cruel behavior from your main character isn't how you grow a audience and i see for the first time this last show\\nhad a lower rating then the previous one.\\nJust finished it they actually nailed the final episode so ill say this is a great series and you should watch it.good job\",\n",
       "   '9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean romantic drama with 16, 60 minute episodes.Park Sae-ro-yi (Park Seo-joon) is a person with a very strong sense of justice and moral integrity. He is an only child being raised by his widowed father and the father and son are the most important thing in each other\\'s worlds. Sae-ro-yi is very goal driven, his dream is to become a police officer, but the dream is shattered when he inserts himself in a bully situation. As the eldest and only legitimate son if the Jangga group, Jang Geun-won (Ahn Bo-hyun) has been groomed by his father to think of those of lower socioeconomic status as beneath him. He is a bully at school, which leads to a violent conflict with Sae-ro-yi who is not the type to stand by and allow it. When the high schoolers are disciplined the school allows Jang Dae-hee (Yoo Jae-myung), Geun-won\\'s father and CEO of Jangga group, to decide the punishment. Since Sae-ro-yi\\'s father happens to work for Jangga group and is a favored employee Dae-hee says he will forgive what he perceives as an insult to his son and family if Sae-ro-yi will kneel and apologize. Sae-ro-yi does not feel as though he has done wrong and refuses to kneel. He is expelled at the recommendation of Dae-hee and Sae-ro-yi stands behind his son and is forced to resign. Things seem to level out when Sae-ro-yi\\'s father utilizes savings to open a restaurant but tragedy strikes and Sae-ro-yi\\'s father is killed in a traffic accident by, none other, than Geun-won. At first Sae-ro-yi does not know the culprit but when he chances to find out who it was, he nearly beats Dae-won to death and serves a 3 year prison sentence for attempted murder. Sae-ro-yi spends his time studying business toward the goal of opening a competing business, DanBam, and ruining Jangga group. An unlikely group of employees/friends work for Sae-ro-yi and he also has the help of a social media guru, Jo Yi-seo (Kim Da-mi) who, after several chance encounters with the affable Sae-ro-yi vows to stay by his side and help him reach his goals. Sae-ro-yi\\'s school friend and first love, Oh Soo-ah (Kwon Nara) works for the Jangga group and Sae-ro-yi still has feelings for her. Will a school drop out and ex-con be able to pull off the take down of a well established conglomerate like the Jangga group? Will Sae-ro-yi go with his feelings for his old love or is this new woman more of his second half?Spoiler Altert** This is a great story that reminds of so many other good stories I have seen in the past. It has elements of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and some Rocky Balboa like elements as well. Like his father who the viewer got to know briefly, Sae-ro-yi is one of those rare people who lets nothing deter him from the right path. He is kind to those that deserve it and harsh on those that do harm to others. The people around him make mistakes but he never holds those types of things against them and it causes everyone in his inner circle to like and admire him. At first I was cheering for his first love, to be the FL and main love interest, but as soon as Yi-seo entered the picture I loved her spunk, energy and the way she was all in with whatever she was doing, including her pursuit of Sae-ro-yi. One of his inner circle is transgender and I was surprised that it portrayed the South Korean people as not very tolerant of different sexual identities. She was one of my favorite characters. Another person in his inner circle was black and there was a lot of prejudice about him being a black Korean. I loved how his business model was about his people and how they, as a result, respected him and loved him like family. He accepted them all for the people they were black, transgender, a little bit psycho and helped them realize their own potential. There were some characters tome that did things that did not make sense. Sae-to-hi did change and harden just a bit which is not such a bad thing but did result in him not forgiving to the same level he did in the past. I loved the friendships and the love story. There were some slow parts toward the end where an element of the story was dragged out more than necessary. Very good and I highly recommend.',\n",
       "   'Later episodes drag on and series is beset by common K-drama tropes. The age old story of the middle class authorities, cops and teachers, bowing to the wealthy class. The son of the antagonist is a bad caricature and the hero is an unbelievable stoic. Some progressive ideas like transgender and multi-racial citizens are put forward. Curious use of the Namsan Seoul Tower which is placed in almost every background shot.',\n",
       "   'I\\'m really surprised by how divisive this show seems to be - based on the reviews it looks like people either hated it or loved it. I fell into the love it category (obviously). Interesting characters and a revenge plot line were the heart of this show, with a subplot of romance that people also either loved or hated. I understand that people don\\'t want to waste their time on a show they won\\'t like, so I would probably advise \"on-the-fence\" viewers that if you don\\'t like Yi-Seo\\'s character from the get-go (I personally loved her), I feel like you won\\'t like this show (based on the other reviews I feel that her character is the perfect benchmark to determine whether or not to keep watching).A small detail that I really loved and just have to point out was the symbolic use of hairstyles in this show. Also this is hella progressive for a KDrama - I loved how they brought up big issues like racism and trans-phobia. It was refreshing since most KDrama\\'s definitely feel like they can be stuck in that awkward 90\\'s phase of mentioning progressive issues in a way that is funny-offensive (think Friends).Itaewon Class was such a great binge-watch, you can\\'t help but want to know how it all turns out, and it has so many \"yell at the screen moments\" that make it truly enjoyable to watch. I did think that towards the end, the choices of some characters felt a bit melodramatic, but this didn\\'t take away from my enjoyment at all. Definitely worth a watch!',\n",

       "   \"The first two episodes were really great, then, I stopped watching after episode 13.

When they ended up together, it was a big eww!',\n",
       "   \"This series is just perfect. I liked everything about it even when things weren't going the way I wished for it. They kinda went crazy in the last episodes but I believe they did that to balance things out. I believe it was to give another purpose for a certain character. The idea of an underdog going against a big corporation is not new but this one was executed perfectly. You won't even hate the parts you are supposed to. It's just so uplifting in every part of it. Perfect revenge story with a great moral boost for those who will for sure relate which in this case pretty much most of us.\",\n",

       "   \"ITAEWON CLASS has a lot of heart. The emotions elicited by the show are on a whole new level. The story is filled with love for family & friends, as well as love for oneself & others. The first two episodes are extremely heavy, but once you get past them, Park SaeRoYi & his Danbam crew will take you on a classic hero's journey.I've never seen Park Seo Joon perform with such zeal. He embraced his role as Saeroyi & poured his heart & soul into it. Though some may regard him as a softie, I admire how Saeroyi remained true to his principles, for better or worse. I's inspired by the importance he placed on integrity & his practice of putting people first. You'll notice his endearing habit of stroking his bowl-cut hair throughout the drama. The gesture humanized him & distinguished Saeroyi from the other characters Seo Joon has played to date.ITAEWON CLASS has all of the elements of a good K-drama. Because of their vulnerability, each character is well-written & realistic. I like how the romantic aspect of the drama was subtly woven into the plot. My heart was racing because the love triangle between Saeroyi, Soo Ah & Yi Seo was so unpredictable. Yi Seo's vulnerability in putting her life on the line for Saeroyi, even in the face of unrequited love, tugged at my heartstrings. Her determination to support & protect Saeroyi exemplifies what girl power is all about. She won me over & inspired me to support her because she never expected anything in return.Another aspect of the script that I liked was the ending. Although the plot spans 15 years, it concludes successfully, with elements planted early on coming into full bloom to support the outcome. For what it's worth, the time I spent in ITAEWON CLASS resulted in a memorable experience. The drama was entertaining & inspiring. It also brought the Itaewon district to life. The drama left me with two important takeaways to remember: people should be at the heart of every business & dreams are worth fighting for.(Ps- It has THE BEST OSTs of recent years. Sweet night- My favorite. It can be played on loop. Start over- Very motivating)\",\n",

Instead over 16 pisodes it rambles and the plot holes and unlikely coincidences become too obvious. There is an interesting sub text going on about what sort of cpitalism - peope or power - os best and some good points on loyalty and friendship.But why is the boss clearly autistic and lets his first love hang around for 15 years (without visibly ageing by the way) and then dumbs her for a girl who is close to being a stalker. Glad to see some diversity in his employees but nothing was ever really explored and were they moonks as well like the boss.I enjoyed this show except for the ridiculous last three episodes.

The scene where he went to confront Jang Geun Won for killing his father is one of the best scene I have watched. He is excellent and he gave it his all. His acting has been steadily improving over the years. The female leads (Kim Da-mi & Nara) are average specially Nara. Another actor worth the praise is Jae-myung Yoo, I always anticipate his scene with Park Seo Joon.The story is intense and fast paced which I love. The first half is superb but it got less interesting as it gradually moves towards the end. I am most unimpressed by the ending of the story. Park Sae Ro Yi didn't get the sweet revenge by his own effort, rather it was Oh Soo Ah who got the job done, Sae Ro Yi simply take the advantage of the situation. It could have been more satisfying to have him get the revenge, I mean, he has been consumed/fuel by his hatred, and suddenly the story just ends like... what? Silent fading without any drama...I was expecting something with a bang!!The romantic aspect of the story I didn't care much who Park Sae Ro Yi chose. I mean people change, feelings change and etc... but of course it would be less controversial if he ends up with Soo Ah, it would have been more consistent with his character. Anyone can see that Jo Yi Seo is not the best match for Park, and I found myself thinking, if in real life, they could certainly split after a few years.The supporting cast and the soundtrack are both superb, BTW, I love the fashion the girls wear specially Kim Da-mi.Summary : an interesting KDrama worth the time.\",\n",

The characters were likeable and the storyline was great. My biggest critique is the love story though. It felt extremely forced, with little to no chemistry between the main character and the love interest. Even with all of its flaws, this is still a well produced k drama with heartwarming moments that somewhat make up for its bad parts.\",\n",

However, it certainly is not representative of the best dramas that Korea has to offer. I could never get behind the Yi Seo character. I found her annoying and obsessive in her love for Saeyori and while she might have a genius IQ, I found it unrealistic to think she was some business genius fresh out of high school. And her callousness towards her co-workers particularly the one who loved her was unforgivable.

It shows the importance of our choices...if you make a mistake, you should take responsibility for your actions, but if you are doing what you think is right, no matter what you will not regret. Above all, it has a very clear message that there is nothing you can\\'t do if you try hard, you just have to get up again everytime you fall.The drama tackles many social issues like injustice in the criminal system, the power of rich vs hardship of poor, discriminations in society, gender/racial issues, taking advantage of orphans and what not.Now, talking about the characters,\\nthe best part about this drama is watching the growth of the lead and side characters. Each character changes throughout the show, completing arcs which are believable and well-earned.Park Sae Joon: Dude! He has the worst haircut of all time. Couldn\\'t avoid mentioning that Sorry! Which was the main reason I pushed this drama till now.Talking about his character...He compels you to think about yourself and your life, he has an interesting view about the world. He loves his people no matter what.His tenacity, stubbornness, and ability to continue to persevere through all the obstacles that have been thrown at him by Jang is what eventually will win your heart. He is positive, emotional, encouraging and has guts.Yi Seo- It\\'s so rare to see really cool female leads that are smart, mean, and likeable. I love the character of YS for not pretending to be nice, for being smart, strong and confident, and being able to fight for herself and her love. Moreover, she doesn\\'t even feel bad for being a badass. I love the way she has no guilt in telling everyone that she is a sociopath. That\\'s the strength of her character. I like her!Soo-Ah- You got to see a lot of character depth in her, and her inner conflicts about what was right and wrong.Jang: He has seen a lot, struggled a lot to be where he is right now and to remain on that position he can do anything to anyone. He can behead anyone also he can bend his knee infront of his enemy just to save his company. His character is cruel and has been played impressively.I find him an inspiring negative character.Geun Won- Ahn Bu Hyun delivered a superb role as a son who longed for his father\\'s love and trying to get it desperately. He is trying enough for the girl he really liked can still love him. He should be loved but...Geun Soo- He sympathetic and loving when he is an outcast but when he decides to join his father, we can see a dark side of him which is a reflection of his dad. He betrays the very friend who accepts him. There was a \"enough is enough\" moment with him which made him what he became.OST: It has THE BEST Soundtrack of recent years!Sweet night- My favourite!

Yi Seo worked so hard to make him successful and happy.I feel touched to see Yi Seo giving Geun Soo a hug when he asked for a handshake during their farewell.

She is an orphan so she has to work harder to live a comfortable life. She studied hard, received financial aid from Jangga Co. and worked for them. \"I am an employee of Jangga Co. and I will always work for Jangga Co.\"She is a successful manager and I like how successful she is after working her way up. She is pretty and capable. I want to be that kind of woman. She waited over 10 years for Park Saeroyi but he fell for someone else instead.

If I talk about some good points, they are good cast, character development to some extent and music. It highlights that one can use modern financial institutions to there gain while many other shows portray them in negative light. There are some problems also like the time span this show covers is 15 years and there are certain gaps in portraying them for instance, a time period of 7 years is skipped altogether and the narrative feels scattered. Also , the narrative is slow in the beginning but picks the pace from last three episodes, so one might feel it boring and difficult to adjust it later.

The actors also did a great job in making the series worth watching. It was all good until episode 15 came. There was this kidnapping scene and the need for the prince charming to rescue her princess which I don't really like. As for the episode 16, there's a lot of unnecessary long stares and talking which shouldn't have took place if it's really an urgent situation. They should have also escaped already the moment they saw Yi Seo, but they chattered and made a drama. I also think that the romantic relationship between Yi Seo and Saeroyi is a bit forced (my opinion only). They could have just sticked to the romcom theme.\",\n",
       "   'I enjoyed this series quite a lot. I don\\'t usually like k-dramas because the romance is extremely slow-burn and the drama is too over the top, like in telenovelas. What\\'s different with this one is that the focus is not on the romance. It has a captivating story that will keep you wanting to see it through to the end.Sadly, some characters are very annoying and the events get a little too ridiculous in some of the last episodes, which almost made me lose interest... but, trust me, it\\'s worth watching till the end just because the main conflict\\'s resolution is very satisfying. It will not disappoint.As for the main cast, Park Sae Ro Yi comes off as strong and inspiring whenever he\\'s in an important scene; the rest of the time, he could be replaced for a wooden plank and we wouldn\\'t notice. Oh Soo Ah\\'s motivations and feelings are confusing and Yi Seo can be really annoying at times. It looked like they tried to make us feel some empathy for Geun Won and I thought he would receive some character depth, but they completely ruin it in the end. All of my praise goes to Yoo Jae-Myung who made a great job as Jang Dae Hee, the main villain; ruthless and dignified but with clear motivations and foreseeable weaknesses. Without him, the series would have probably been a flop.I dropped a couple points because of the problems mentioned above, but the series has just enough jaw-dropping moments to make up for it and make it watchable. Plus, the OST was the best part of it. Ha Hyun Woo\\'s voice is amazing, and his theme \"Diamond/Stone Block\" along with Gaho\\'s \"Start Over\" are definitely going into my playlist.

I did like the ending though however they were few episodes in the middle where they went astray.Characters were really really good especially Kim da-mi's character was badass and blunt which you wouldn't see in any other show. This show covered the dark side of the korea they delivered racism and gender discrimination on the spot.Soundtracks were the best compared to any kdrama I've watched.Overall, highly recommend and take my word that you wouldn't regret it.\\n9/10\",\n",

       "   \"The very first episode of IC did a good job to make me cry when Sae Ro Yi's Dad was tragically died. While, Sae Ro Yi truly loves his Dad and i can feel his loss, that's the point which I really admire Park Seo Joon's natural acting. Then, i watched more episodes, i really love to watch when Jo Yi Seo comes into Sae Ro Yi's life. Then, the more episodes i watched.. i feel like the plot is quite predictable for me somehow. So, that's why i give 8/10 here. I watched this drama till the end, and help me, I ship Sae Ro Yi and Jo Yi Seo at first but in the end i feel like Oh Soo Ah is not a bad girl to be paired up with Sae Ro Yi. So, in this drama, I think Oh Soo Ah is a character that make me curious to watch this drama till the end because of her turning point on episode 15. Overall, good job!\",\n",

I loved the premise of this show, the plot was set up very nicely, making the first two episodes the best in the whole show. The actors all did an absolutely amazing job and I found all of them a perfect fit for their roles.However, after episode four, everything dragged on. The plot was becoming more and more slow and it took several episodes for actual progress to be made. Something else that bothered me as well was how questionable some of the characters were becoming. Jo yi-seo was a character I never grew to like mostly because of how easily she changed her mind when it came to serious issues. She was being transphobic to Hyeon yi and all of a sudden was super friendly to her just like that. Same thing happened with her racist behaviour towards Kim Toni. Oh Soo Ah was another character that bugged me a lot. Don't get me wrong, it's always a really good thing when our characters are actual humans, they're not meant to please us in a show, it's just with her I could never understand the way she acted.Overall it's an ok show, some people will probably love it, others will hate it.

For example, the supporting cast involved characters from all different walks of life and is a good affirmation of that saying: \"never judge a book by its cover\". It highlighted discrimination, gender issues, corporate power/greed, and perserverance very well. There were some scenes which were a bit lacking and the chemistry b/w the lead actors could have been stronger, but overall this drama was well written and directed.Storyline -- started off great but then overly exaggerated towards the end with unncessary back and forth revenge acts, and in particular, Jo Yi-seo\\'s character who was just annoying, irritating and difficult to watch\\n/ Acting -- great execution and compelling performances by Park Seo-joon in his portrayal as Park Saeroyi, and from Yoo Jae-myung who played Jang Dae-hee (CEO of Jangga Pub)\\n/ Characters -- I loved that each character came from all different walks of life and was determined to put up a fight regardless of societal standards and values\\n/ OST -- wasn\\'t that big of a fan of the (pop rock) OST to be honest but maybe just a few song selections here and there',\n",

We weren't shown a crew having exceptionally nice and caring and understanding characters. They developed into that, and still retained the part of their personality. Each of them was different and had so much to contribute to the story.The annoying thing about the show? HOW COME EVERYBODY MEET THE REQUIRED PERSON WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE?

I\\'m a relative newcomer to Korean dramas, but I was lucky enough to stumble across first My Mister (IMDB rating 9.1) and then in short order this Itaewon Class. My Mister was the best drama I\\'ve ever seen anywhere and Itaewon Class is just as good. Both were for me inspiring and very emotionally engaging, where the world and the characters depicted seemed real, and was sad to have to eventually leave it all behind. The writing and the acting In Itaewon Class is so good I find myself rewatching scenes and choking up. Take as an example a climactic scene involving a cooking contest. Ha-ha, doesn\\'t sound like much? It was actually brilliant writing.I particularly loved the female lead Jo Yi Seo (Kim Da-Mi, whose acting is so good I just can\\'t do it justice here) - such an original, indomitable, smart and savvy character, and that\\'s what made her sudden helpless attraction and devotion to Sae Ro Yi so touching and impressive. While it was a bit unbelievable how long it took Sae Ro Yi to reciprocate (16 episodes), it seemed believable that when it happened, it hit him like the proverbial ton of bricks. I loved that.The writing, direction and the acting in this series are absolutely top notch. It\\'s a bit disparaging to lump it into a \"KDrama\" category, as if it\\'s all a bunch of predictable tropes, or derivative based on the real (Hollywood) thing. These dramas are originals, depicting the best and the worst within their own culture.

PSJ's character doesn't have anything special (except for his determination & kindness towards his staff), other than than, he doesn't have what it takes to be super successful. I don't understand how he managed to beat a multi national company when he doesn't know about business ( no development from beginning til the end) and with his recipe which I didn't find special. You can also skip some episodes and still understand the entire story. PsJ acting is good but he doesn't have to scream every time. :) I feel like he can use different techniques to express his anger. The ending was so unrealistic as well.

       "   'An excellent drama where the main theme is revenge & I\\'m a big fan of Korean revenge films. Having lived in South Korea for a year, I know Koreans are a proud nation, and knowing their history it\\'s understandable. Korean actors never seem to \"phone in\" their performances; they give it 110%, no matter the importance of their role.This is my third K-drama & I\\'ve noticed writers like to add a \"twist\" to the story to throw off viewers. I do understand some suspension of belief must be held in this fictional world, but I do like intelligent writing that does not insult the viewer. And most of the writing in this drama is intelligent, but I couldn\\'t fathom how the male lead (Park Saeroyi) fell in love with his manager (Jo Yi Seo). First, she\\'s much younger. Second, she\\'s plain looking even with tons of make-up. Finally, and most importantly, she doesn\\'t have a winning personality that would enhance for her looks; she\\'s actually a complete brat. I love how in the final episode, in a tense life or death situation, she runs away like a coward brat and leaves Chairman Yang\\'s youngest son to fend for himself. He had deep feelings about her during the whole series, unlike her boss (Park Saeroyi), who showed NO like/love interest in her until near the end of the series.To be fair, Park Saeroyi is somewhat of one note (but extremely focused), \"no-game\" dude who still hadn\\'t kissed a girl by 34 years old.........weak! But throughout most of the series it\\'s obvious who he has deep feelings for......his middle school crush (Oh Soo Ah). He even stated in episode 2 he likes her because she\\'s \"very pretty\". And she is fine. So fine, that him and the Chairman Jang\\'s oldest, rich son have the hots for her. But she is more than just a pretty face. She\\'s intelligent, successful & driven and deeply cares about Park Saeroyi. Yes, she is a little shallow, but given her characters background it is somewhat understandable. She was abandoned by her mother to an orphanage. Nobody loved her, and she despised any pity thrown her way. Considering this scarred background, she turned out well. And she is NOT an irritating brat. The Jo Yi Seo character comes across as a nutty stalker type that will profess her love for you for many years, and will kill your pets & slash your tires if you dare go for another woman.The writers got too cute. They should have written the series as more of an obvious love match. Have Saeroyi & Oh Soo Ah be together at the end & have Jo Yi Seo slowly fall for the younger son of Chairman Yang. He was a good-looking kid & had positive traits. The reason his character changed and became more like his sinister, but smart, father was Jo Yi Seo drove him in that direction. Actually, I\\'m not sure what his character saw in the Jo Yi Seo character. But I guess you must put aside all realistic plotlines in the fiction world of K-drama.',\n",
       "   \"Everything in this drama was just sooo good, the songs, the friendship and also the relationship was pretty good! It was most focused on their friendship but the story as well was really good! I need more korean drama's like this !\",\n",
       "   'I really wanted to like this drama but I come away feeling oddly disappointed.In what I assume is netflix\\'s influence shining through, themes such as racism and bigotry towards the LGBTQ community are touched upon and mostly with a deft hand. A welcome change compared to the conservative \"normal\" dramas.Yet there are just so many flaws. I am glad that at several points during this show, it gets mentioned that if you get the basics right, you will succeed. Well, let\\'s examine where Itaewon Class didn\\'t get their basics right then.The first few episodes are great, set up the premise perfectly, make you interested and empathetic with the main characters. Sadly, starting in the middle and especially towards the end, this drama squanders all this hope and becomes a repetitive, boring revenge plot, sacrificing the emotional stakes and relationships.What is also to be lamented is the fact that Yi-seo somehow manages to be even more unlikable than Soo-ah and that is saying something. I get subverting the genre staple of having a childhood connection/ soulmate vibe/ meant to be love story and I am all here for that. But Yi-seo is so terrible from the get-go and don\\'t even get me started on kissing/ caressing a sleeping character who has repeatedly stated he has zero interest in you romantically. That is just gag inducing.Now Soo-ah, I was intrigued by her character in the beginning. But it just does not make sense. Her \"excuse\" for dedicating her entire life to a man and a company that killed her only father figure, covered it up and had someone she considered at least a friend pay for it: \"I am not like you, I am not brave\". Huh, well then. She is smart and pretty, and Mr. Park paid her tuition, yet instead of going to university and finding a job, she \"HAS\" to work for Jang Dae-hee/ Jangga? Yeah, sorry as far as character motivation goes, that one makes no sense to me.\\nAlso pray tell what is that nonsense that is supposed to be her relationship with Sae-ro-yi? She seems to genuinely be conflicted but how does she have any loyalty towards Jangga? make it make sense! Also it is beyond any stretch of the imagination that two people somehow are single without any ANY dating or even any interest in doing so for 20 years. Like what even... Why bother making the viewer care for their relationship? I don\\'t even know how many episodes I spent waiting for her to come to her senses, quit Jangga and go over to Sae-ro-yi to tell him she had been an idiot all these years, loves him etc... Instead I had to watch Yi-seo stalk him and basically assault him for episode after epsiode.For the record, I stopped watching around episode 14, I just couldn\\'t take it anymore, it started to feel like work, getting through the episodes.I am glad I watched other dramas Park Seo-joon did before this one, because I would not be interested in watching anything with him based solely on Itaewon Class. Not sure who is to blame here, but his acting is convincing and heartbreaking in the first few (2) episodes and then he becomes this mostly expressionless, boring character for almost the entire show. I guess there isn\\'t all that much you can do when the character is what it is.So yeah, disappointed in this show that could have been so much more. Would not recommend.',\n",

While the story unfolds we as audience learn very valuable life lessons so it is a very teachable series. The lack of romance doesn't mean lack of love because it depicts a very unique selfless, pure, unconditional & passionate kind of love which is not limited by romance. Love so true that a person is willing to bet their life on it on one side, while for someone it takes years to develop instead of love at first sight. It also tells us that love at first sight or first love is overrated while true love is the one that grows stronger with time by overcoming hardships together through years. This show also stands out in showing good range of diversity & unique characters - Hero with great principles, badass sociopath girl, ex convicts, transgender, good guy turned bad, half black half Korean guy, career driven modern day woman, nerd, bully, evil businessman.

It's these subtle details that bring the story to a deeper level, giving it more substance.Many movie/drama that I watched before pay more attention to plot.

There is no personality such park sae ro yi.\\n2. Why didn\\'t the sae ro yi\\'s hairstyle change after 11 years?\\n3. Why get out of the car at the end of episode 14 and worse, hug each other?\\n4. It was a cliché hostage!\\n5. How did Hyun Yi become a chef?((Because these questions are very repetitive, I would like to explain my point of view in detail))1.\\nFor example, do zombies really exist? (Kingdom 2019)\\nIs Gandalf in the real world? (Lord of the Rings 2001)\\nDo people die in reality, do they steal in their sleep, or is the food of the whole world corn? (Inception 2010 -interstellar 2015)\\nWe have rome of Subconsciously dreams? (Stalker 1979)\\nIn fact, can humans go back to 1700 or 1500?\\n(Midnight in Paris 2013)\\nDoes in our planet We have a fish that become a monster that breathes out of sea?\\n(The Host 2006)Well, these are some of the most famous and highest level productions, and popular directors like Christopher Nolan, great directors like Bong Joon Ho and Woody Allen, and directors who are among the top two or three in history like Andrei tarkovsky.Surely you are saying that all of them are fantasy or science fiction, but the Itaewon class is a drama and realistic, so it doesn\\'t suit him.Well, I have to say that we have a style that a combination of fantasy and realism is called magical realism!\\nBut... This series is not magical realism at all!\\nI just wanted to say that there is such a style, and for example, kill me heal me has such a genre, that is, in the real world, with real rules, but a couple of motifes are unrealistic in it.Now that itaewon class is not magical realism, then how is it realistic ?!So is there a guarantee that there will be no person like sae ro yi in the world?\\nNo, we don\\'t have the Innocent people, but we do have the people that have a little negative morals and the park sae ro yi were the same.2. Well, when do people\\'s hairstyles change when they change themselves; For example, in classic movies, whenever women cut their hair short, it means that they are tough and their personality getting cold.\\nWell, we see that from the beginning, the sae ro yi and Jang Deh-hee do not change, but the others change to accompany them.\\nFor example, yi seo, which could not be changed at all, she changed because of the sae ro yi, but on the other hand soo ah, she did not change, and their destiny became that.\\n(You may say why the sae ro yi should not be changed and turned upside down. First of all, this could be the opposite and it could have been the opposite. Now it doesn\\'t matter, but let\\'s calculate that the sae ro yi was a symbol of good behavior. ...)\\nOr Jang Deh Hee didn\\'t change and his son became like him to be with him.3. So tell me, what difference does it make if the car is looking for a car or a person?\\nYou just saw that sae ro yi made Jang Gion Won\\'s car have to go a long way and he had a plan and the time to buy... You say why they hugged each other in that sensitive moment... Well, we knew that this is just a drama, but In fact, they are close to death and sae ro yi probably want to say something that has been in his heart for a long time , and his feelings become uncontrollable, and... Incidentally, this scene, which we think is stupid, is like a real person. Foolish moment!4. First of all, tell me what is your favorite series?\\nIf you want to try to say Kdrama\\'s avangard, you probably say, \"My Ajusshi or Mr. Sunshine its probably the answer of 80%. \"\\nDo you want me to tell these clichés?\\nStereotypes are not a negative in themselves; How long did it take for the hostage-taking to end?\\nMaybe half a episode.\\nWell, no matter how much you write a new product, there are similarities with something and somewhere.5. Well in ep 4:\\nYou see, when yi seo want to show her abilities to be hired, she turns to park sae ro yi and says:\\nWhat kind of food is your specialty?\\nwe carefully came up with every recipe, but we dont realy have a specialty.The camera in the fridge or freezer or whatever, Hyun yo and yi sro in front of the fridge.\\nHyun Yi: i organized it yesterday. Its all clean.\\nYi seo: we dont need many things on the menu.\\nJusy have one specialty and use two or three overlapping ongredients to keep losses to a minimum.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nWell, you see, now it makes more sense that Hyun Yi has succeeded with repetition and effort because they have limited their list.This is from this.What else can I tell you?The Park Seo Joon, Kim Da Mi, Nara, Yo Jae Myung, Anh Bo Hyun , are all currently running in Baeksang.\\nI mean, the whole series is almost nominated, and we have to see what happens.\\nDo I need to tell you more about acting?The director of the series has been nominated, but since it is difficult for you to understand the difference between a good director and others:See the first part of ep 4 the conversation between the sae ro yi and Gion Won. First, Gion Won comes with pride to make fun of the sae ro yi but...So director how show me sae ro yi\\'s Self Confidence and geon won\\'s stress with camera?\\nExactly at the end of episode 15, when he kneels ; It slows motion and keeps that beautiful movement going, and more importantly, the camera slowly goes to sae ro yi, and somehow admires it by going to it and approaching it!End of episode 11\\nHow effective was the silence we saw at the time of the confession?\\nTell more about the script and its details?\\nThe fact that he puts Yi Seo and Soo ah in the cafe in front of each other and marks.Sae ro yi open up his heart to yi seo in ep4...\\nWhy did he tell yi seo what he didn\\'t do to soo ah all the time?\\nBecuase he feel comfortable around her.\\nShould I talk about music?Music?\\nYou mean, like, all these records aren\\'t enough for gaho and v?\\nIt\\'s okay to serve you. I have to say that at the Baeksabg Festival, they have a special technical awards , and the Itaewonclass is nominated for its music.\\nBasically, you go and listen to the itaewon class from the album of soundtrackthe whole series will be reviewed for you.We have how many marking and motif like \"how does it taste?\"\\nHow many times have you seen such a beautiful motif in Kdrama before?Well, I typed for about 30 minutes, I think that\\'s enough.I have nothing more to say; Of course probably !!!',\n",

It also portrays how the contemporary Korean society is with tourists, other races, racism, and not-every-main-lead-is-a-'chaebol'(rich ass).

The acting is superb, from each and every one of the cast. The story is as much exciting as it is sweet and heartbreaking. Some reviewers say that the episodes get weaker by the end: That's just wrong. In fact, it's the opposite. The pace goes up a lot after the last time-skip. It's a perfect timing as, by then, all the relationships are at their beats/peaks, which is when it's time to focus on the actual premise of the series.The only thing I would have loved is if they took some more episodes to get this over with. It felt a tiny bit rushed by the end, for a show that would have totally deserved 18-20 episodes unlike some of the other more lengthy kdramas. But that's not a reason at all to skip this one. It's a kdrama through and through and easily deserves a 8+ rating for what it is and for what it is meant to be. You won't be disappointed.\",\n",

His staff and their backstories and character developments were good.Chairman Jang was very effective. His eldest son is also effective. Their faces are really annoying, suited for villain roles. Kim Dong Hee, the younger son - protagonist turned villain, is just good in the start when he was a good guy. He is bad as a villain, but maybe the script requires him to remain a good boy with bad intentions, or kind-looking with bad agenda-style. He did well in Extra-curricular, though, but his acting as a villain did not help the show at all.The start is intense. I agree with others that it gets dragging at some point plus a lot of flashbacks and unnecessary conversations. I think each episode could have been 10-15 mins less.I also observe some flaws typical of drama series - why did she do this/that, how come this and that... etc. I used to this kind of flaws so it is just 'something to laugh' to me.Rewatch value if this show is high for me.

Throughout the story it feels like the board was set from the beginning for the protagonist's success.We totally skip the part where the Hero did in full control try to commit murder, although punished for it. The story made it out so that it was the villian who put him in prison. Did the villain try to cover up the hit and run, yes he did but he didn't cause the car accident in the first place.I would have loved to see the hero make the choices which actually led him to success rather than just shouting at other to be righteous all the time.I would have loved to see him struggle to wake up and still go to work, handle customers who didn't behave well, actually fire an employee who wasn't able to grow up in the end(because not everyone can actually step up)\",\n",

The material was good for 13 episodes, but because they needed to stretch it out to 16 episodes, the last few episodes were filled with long drawn out unnecessary scenes.Addressed issues such as mental health, the trans community, foreigners in Korea etc, and the prejudices these different groups of people face.Almost every character was substantially developed, except for one of the main characters, Yi Seo. Which was a huge pitfall for the entire show. She, remained childish, entitled, unforgiving even till the end. EVERY OTHER main/supporting character showed development. Be it in maturity, forgiveness, self-awareness or self-improvement. She was goal driven, but her goal was a shallow one. To get Saeroyi to fall in love with her.For a show trying to cast light on social issues in Korea, romanticising sexual assault was gross. Just because the perpetrator was the young female protagonist madly in love with the male lead, doesn't make it right.The fact that in the end Saeroyi fell in love with such a shallow character who stalked him and pestered him for 4 years was a huge turn-off.Itawon Class TL:DR - Psychologically damaged male lead falls in love with his stalker who remains childish and obsessive even after becoming the CFO of a huge listed company and getting the man of her dreams.\",\n",

After that the plot started to become frustrating, the main character(Park Sae-ro-yi) started to lose his charm, actually no real emotion was portrayed through him. The vengeance concept was never questioned and it started to become stressful to watch.\\nThe romance went the worst way possible. There is really no justification for this. That four years leap made the plot a mess, so, after episode 13 it became just unwatchable.Performance of the artists were great. Kim Da Mi had a powerful character(Jo Yi-seo), which if not likable was very refreshing...but became dull and annoying as the story progressed. Park Seo-joon did great, just like the plot he was wonderful at the beginning, heart rending acting but his character never really got past the revenge arch, was particularly inept in the romance part. And I don't think that's the actor's fault, the plot was very weak. Now, very few reviews appreciated Kwon Nara's(Oh Soo-ah) performance, but I found her amazing. Till episode 13, though the plot really didn't let her flourish, she was outstanding. All those complicated emotions was perfectly expressed by her...there was no way to bypass her and bring the other romantic counter part to be the final love. But that's what happened and ruined the whole tension that was built through the previous episodes. There was more chemistry between her and the main character than Kim Da Mi and him.Ending was really messy, villains lost their charisma, Kim Dong-hee's character(Jang Geun-soo) didn't receive any understandable closure and the final revenge and happy ending was totally shallow and out of the blue, not convincing at all. Kwon Nara's character was totally ignored where she had amazing potential and Park Sae Joon's character was totally lost by the end.But for the first 11 episodes it deserves applause, the views of Itaewon was eye catching at times and the music brilliant.It was that unbelievable wrecking ending which just ruined the amazing show that it could become.\",\n",

Specially \"Still Fighting It\" awesome!! lyrics says it all about this drama!We seen from the beginning how it all started....His father death, hatred and building himself from the ground to get his revenge, but looking it back, he didn\\'t actually had any closures of his father death. I completely forgot this because I am so into how he will get his revenge, until the final episodes! which was a relieved - he finally embrace and accepted the death of his father, and for me that\\'s the best and outstanding ending. And to be honest! I cried my hearts out. He can finally move on be happy with the person he love. Hence, \"I will do it a million times if he have to\" because, saving the person he love is more than going through loosing someone again!On the other hand, some viewers are looking into how he will get his revenge, but at the end, it\\'s the childhood friend Oh Soo-Ah got the final card to take Jangga Co. Never really like her in the beginning for betraying Park Sae-ro-yi, taking the scholarship and working for Jangga Co, not sticking to her principles, however, her character is outstanding; confused and selfish! I knew she had a plan or something, but why taking this long!Having said all these, although Park Sae-ro-yi lost his guard and principles, at the end it pays it all off and that is the icing on the cake!....Chairman Jang kneels down before Park Sae-ro-yi!! So, no matter how you look at the ending, for me, it sums it all up.Absolutely outstanding performance!! now, the question is, is there a season 2???....unless the youngest son became a MAN! and still have feelings for Kim Da-mi, then that\\'s a different story, who knows! But overall this drama is one of the best and one of my favourite! Love it. Park Seo-Joon one of a kind and brilliant actor!',\n",

       "   'This movie makes me realize about many aspect... it also make me know that one little person that don\\'t have anything perfect can do something very big. It\\'s really impressed me, it makes me feel like if I have more patient of doing something and have a spirit to reach the goal, I can change something to be in my way and I can do something very big too. About the story, there is a lot of stressful, actually when I start watching this, I can\\'t even know how a group of a few people will pass through all the problem they\\'ve met, because the goal is very big and it look too hard for them. I only cheer them up in my mind because I guess that there is no way to achieve their goal at all even if they try very hard. But at the end they can and that\\'s make me feel really happy with their achievement. However, there are many scenes that I think I don\\'t really happy with, one is the main woman character, I don\\'t think she will be the last woman whom the main character go out with and I also don\\'t like this kind of character as much because all she think or all she does is for the main character I think she is too adhere to the main character, I always think that \"why you have to try hard like this\" or \"there are many thing that you can do for yourself\" ...however, she is the main point and the key of this movie, if she is not here beside the main character, To reach the goal is absolutely hopeless. By the way, even if there are something I like or don\\'t like but It\\'s one of the best movies of my favorite. If you have time you can try once and you will understand what I really feel.',\n",

The revenge was perfectly planned out with a 15year plan and was perfectly executed.The reason this isn't a 9 or a 10 is because of its boring love triangle which looked too forced and would been better to focus on the revenge more.

There's no meaningful message in it.I got so upset that such a selfish, terrible person like Yi-seo who treats her friend known as Geun-soo and people around terribly is supported in this series. She ended up having everything she wants. Park Saeroyi is simply boring. He couldn't keep his promises with Soo-ah which I don't find it cool. And Oh Soo-ah is just a useless character. She can do bad things to hurt the one she likes for no reason.It's such a bad ending where chairman Jang got no lesson about life and family. His family remains broken.I just can't understand why this series has such a good rating. The story is too simple. There's no deep views into human emotions. No inspiration I could find. It's simply about boring love, hatred. As a person who has watched Korean dramas for more than 20 years. I really don't think this drama deserves this highly rating.\",\n",

Their determination and personal sacrifices were so in tune with each other, it would make so much more meaningful story, especially because it's less realistic in real life (after all it's all about the fairy tale stories, isn't it?). Well, it was a disappointing ending to a great original show with a lot of potential. Nevertheless, acting was good.\",\n",

Her character was awesome and the actress was perfectly cast. I did feel a little bad Soo-ah but she was selfish and always pushed Park Sae-Roy whereas Yi-Seo lived for him and gave her heart and soul for him selflessly! I hope there's a season 2!!!\",\n",

Son Ye Jin looking much like she did in Crash Landing's Seri plays a dermatologist. The second girl friend is about to fall for a younger man. The third is terminally ill. The terminal illness thing was just done in Song Hye Kyo's Now We are Breaking Up. That's not the only similarity. The first episode also features a sexual relationship and then the couple starts the relationship from the beginning. I think this one is better. The dialogue is good and the relationships are mature and supportive. It's only 12 episodes so it should not get draggy but half way through there is too much about the terminal illness. Also Yeon Woo Jin as the male lead is a bit bland.\",\n",

This is great and as far as I watch kdrama this new at least to me.The acting of the casts to me are splendid, Main cast e.g Mido perfectly played in her role as semi girly woman which loving married guy and mostly put her shelf to backup her besties. The emotion, gesture & expression just perfect!Son Yejin, no doubt to me. In any movie and drama I seen her always brave to show different type of characters and successfully hypnotized me to join her anger with mido bf and in the scene brought me laugh with her silly face defence the farting was not hers.Kim Jihyuning as an innocent 39 woman made the friendship are just perfect and with the all characters compositionNot boring. I sense that because during the show, each of the scenes i followed almost 100% - afraid of missing important story, this type of style fit well on meWoojin, I knew him from this show as a sweet, caring & loving man I would say superb. Small gesture, eyes play, words already showing the strong characters of doctor which unexpectedly in love with mijoMijo sister is a show stealer even she has few scene but succesfully made this drama a great show.Looking forward for the next episode.',\n",
       "   'I love the camaraderie of these girls. I like the way the script jumps from the present to the past to show how our heroines got to where they are. Failed relationships and choices that have unintended consequences, just life. We know from the get-go that there is heartache coming. I appreciated how we see the raw emotions that we all feel at times, so well portrayed. Binged watch what I could so far. It reminds us that no matter what we go through, it is wonderful to have friends and family that have our backs.',\n",
       "   \"I have never seen a line-up of reviews with tens in a row except for the snore-fest. But that's unfortunate.Sometimes, not often, we find a gem in Netflix, these days the gems come most often from K-drama. This one, is surely a gem. From every angle, it shines, from the acting, from the script, from the story, from the dynamics of the three friends, from the human-interest, I think you get my meaning. Those three friends, the camaraderie,, the banter, the jesting, the kidding, the ribbing, everything about them rings so true and so perfect. You forget you are watching a movie, you feel like you are eavesdropping on these friends, the script, the lines are so well written, so natural, true to life, the way those girls bring the lines from pages to the story, is superb. This is exactly the way three close friends interact.Hollywood has not given us anything close to this kind of spectacular human interaction movie in decades. The closes I can think of is Sleepless in Seattle. These day, Hollywood banks on their ace actors, Top Gun, Independence Day, Monkey men, action heroes, Marvel characters, Spiderman, Ironman, Batman, Superman, etc. When was the last time we had a movie from Hollywood that tug at our heart-strings, make us tear up? You get all these from K-dramas.If you want an example, check this out, and don't wake up snore-fest from his sleep.\",\n",

       " 'Sweet Home': [[\"SWEET HOME is a South Korean TV show from 2020 now available for viewing on Netflix. It's based on a 'web toon', whatever that is, and I went into it with a few reservations that were quickly blown away from the end of the first instalment. This ten-episode, hour long series explores the lives of a group of residents at a tower block who wake up one day to find the world destroyed and rampaging mutated monsters killing anyone who ventures out of doors. Even worse, some of their own are infected and in the process of becoming monsters themselves!Handsomely shot and mounted, this possesses all of the quality acting you expect from Korean cinema and television, and the realistically-drawn character portraits of people you don't always like or love but who ring true to life: the conflicted, suicidal teenager; the stroppy guitarist; the masculine firefighter; the scarred gangster with a talent for torture. Interesting character development is interspersed with outlandish action and fight scenes every episode as the dwindling characters encounter one nightmarish creation after another. The CGI effects aren't meant to be photorealistic but I grew to love them anyway as they fit the show's fantastic landscape. Twisty, turning, surprising and grisly, with a consistent quality from beginning to end, this might well be the TV show of the year.\",\n",
       "   \"The story rushes into assorted monster attacks too quickly without establishing an emotional connection with the characters or background story. Not scary or exciting if you don't care for the characters. Unusual for a Korean series to lack an emotional connection. This series has a one dimensional story with less depth than usual. Only later in flashbacks do you get to know the characters but it's too late by then. The viewer is plunged into a post apocalyptic gory mess quite quickly without enough explanation and the attacks feel repetitive and monotonous. And the gratuitous violence is out of place in a Korean series.\\nVisually the monsters and effects look good. The cast is good and likeable with 18 Again's Lee Do Hyun, Love Alarm's Song Kang, Lee Jin Wook surprisingly good as a tough guy and Park Kyu Yung of It's Okay.\\nI prefer Kingdom or the excellent Odd Family Zombie for Sale to Sweet Home.\",\n",
       "   \"Sweet Home (2020) is a Korean horror television series available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a virus outbreak that turns people into monsters. The storyline evolves around a group of survivors inside a residential high rise building while chaos takes place outside.The writing for this is very inconsistent. The first four episodes were out of this world A+ action and horror scenes. It was so fun. I thought this show was Amazing out of the gate. However, the storyline quickly shifts from the cool monsters to the humans hybrids and their conflicting feelings about the surviving humans. Overall this series had a lot of potential and falls apart halfway through. The series was a 10/10 through 4-5 episodes and then 3/10 the last 5 so I'd give this a 5.5/10.\",\n",
       "   \"Korean Drama 'Sweet Home' has awful CGI, but it makes up with the on-point atmosphere. The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive. However, this season felt more like the introduction, as we start to get to know each character and bond with them, without, nevertheless, getting too deep into the mystery of what is happening and why and how to move forward. Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline. The pace is also perfect for the action element of the story. Finally, the performances were all quite emotional.So, overall, 7 out of 10.\",\n",
       "   'Sweet Home: South-Korean TV series, mostly set in an apartment block. There is a conspiracy at work here, some state actors new things were wrong before the outbreak. People transform into different types of monsters, zombies, giant spiders, gel creatures, shape-shifters. A motley crew try to survive in the block, infighting, suspicion are rife but people also co-operate. Dark in more ways than one with the tower block interiors. Some of the back stories are a bit soapish but others contain elements of existential terror. Some great fight scenes with the mnsters but there are also tangles with marauders and soldiers. Great fun. Multipe directors and writers based on the Naver webtoon of the same name by Kim Kan-bi and Hwang Young-chan. On Netflix. 8/10.',\n",

       "   'After watching Squid Game and Alice in Borderland I thought this would be something similarly great.But when I heard the line \"Go commit suicide somewhere else\" I was like wow, this is introducing garbage characters from episode one. And of course, the main character just takes it.And that\\'s just it, the entire thing relies too heavily on the characters, but most of them are forgettable trash, and nothing too interesting happens to get you invested.It\\'s all confusing too, I had to search online for explanations as to what happened exactly, since even after watching the final episode I was confused.So yeah, surprisingly disappointing.',\n",
       "   \"Enjoyable, but somewhat odd. The creatures are great, not always realistic looking. That's not what's odd. What's odd is overly long shots of people just looking or staring with no expression on their faces.Maybe it's a cultural thing but no one really seems to react to anything with fear, even curiosity. Things just happen in front of them and they just stand there staring at it. A 10-ft tall thing with elongated legs and arms and everyone just stands there going, what is that? And then as it approaches them, nobody moves they just stand there. Its it's bizarre.A lot of characters are introduced, but you start to be able to distinguish who's who and what they're doing and who's brave, who's a coward, who probably needs to be killed by the monsters, and who you're going to enjoy being killed by the one of the monsters.Another strange aspect to this series is Marlboro Man. the dude in the suits what's up with him is he infected, is he not infected, or did he just happen to be caught up in this when he was robbing somebody???I'm three episodes in and I can't tell yet. Stuck in the house during the pandemic you could do worse.\",\n",

Well acted and a good storyline which is based on a web toon which is apparent in the direction which focuses on reaction and shock in short stints. You might want to view it with the lights on as the monsters are pretty scary.',\n",
       "   \"The story is addicting enough to make you want to know what happens at the end. There are some attempts at character development to provide some reasoning for the motivations. It is Return of the Living Dead, X-Men and the Mist.\\nThere are many comments about the horrible CGI and it is true. The CGI was almost at a level of a talented teenager with a laptop and Adobe. Since the series has certain level of dark comedy, I was able to look past that. I was not able to look past that this 10-hour series could have very easily been a very good 2.5 hour movie. There was extremely amount of filler that did not provide any additional context to the move.Other big problem was editing which is the reasoning for my 4 stars. It is disjointed to say the least. It is almost like they taped entire scenes and then cut out the bloopers or mistakes and stitched together what was left with reshooting anything. There are many jumps, skips and entire characters appearing and not appearing and darkness that makes it hard to know what is going on(think Game of Thrones White Walker battle in Season 8). A five second action scene can have 15+ edits and you end up confused. Other big issue....the ending, I have no idea what happened in the last 15 minutes.For some people this may be a 7 or 8 star while for most 'adults' it will be 6 at best.\",\n",
       "   'If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic themes, monsters, and gore, then this series probably got your attention. It got mine.Sweet Home (2020) is heavy on gore, suspense, and drama. The gore is self-explanatory. The other two need in-depth details.The suspense is what kept me going. Not only because of the thrilling moments but also the curiosity to know what will happen next. Every episode does a great job of raising a question, a concern, and leaving answers for later. This kept my attention and gave me the motivation to keep watching until the end.Finally, the drama. This series is great about portraying the drama involved in this whole situation. And the character acting is outstanding. You care for people, you hate some people, you cheer for the heroes. In the end, I think this is all about humans, even though the main problem is the monsters.As for the monsters, I have to mention the cheap CGI. It definitely breaks your immersion. You need to numb your mind to this and watch it for the plot. In contrast, the practical effects are well done.I would definitely recommend it to everyone, but I know this is not for everyone. Casual watchers will not like this series. Gore and monster lovers will like it, maybe.',\n",
       "   \"If this was an American series it would get torn apart and all you have to do is look at the ratings of any of similar shows that have been on TV other than WD or AHS and even those are have lower overall ratings. An anti American bias by Americans taints every bit of pop culture this gets a boost it deserves simply by it not coming from the US. I love this show it's not only a great horror show it's also an excellent mystery and has spots of comic relief. The story the acting the pace and its presentation are all excellent and while the CGI is not the best it's good enough that it's not unintentionally funny.\",\n",

Despondent and suicidally depressed, Hyun-soo moves into a large apartment building and continues his life of solitude. That is until strange things begin occurring in the building and he and his neighbors must rely on each other to survive. Something is causing people to turn into horrible, blood thirsty, destructive monsters and it is hard to know who to trust. Martial law is declared throughout South Korea but this little micro chasm of humanity must endure and fight both the monsters within as well as out.Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kang). A teenager who lost the will to live after losing his entire family, finds himself in a hell like existence where humans turned monster roam about and it is hard to know who to trust. Winds up becoming part monster but is able to control it giving him superhuman powers.Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook) no one is quite sure who he is but he is willing to do what others will not and punish evil doers as he sees fit. He looks rough and gangster like in appearance with a heavily scarred face. He is abnormally strong and ruthless.See Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young) a character created for the drama (not webtoon) she is an expert martial artist who served in special forces and was also a fire fighter. After her fiancé vanished mere sprays before their wedding, she has trust issues.Lee Eun-hyuk (Lee Do-Hyundan) is th self designated leader of the group of survivors whose cold rationality makes his leadership strong but cause there\\'s to consider him unfeeling.

Park Yoo-ri Is his caregiver and knows his grumpy facade hides his caring nature.Han Du-sik (Kim Sang-ho) Former military man with skill in creating weapons. Although bound to a wheelchair his a kill with weapons makes him an invaluable member of the group..\\nKim Suk-hyun (Woo Hyun) is both mentally and physically abusive to his wife. He owns a grocery but is reluctant to share food even in the apocalyptic scenario. He frequently creates tension in the group.Ahn Sun-young (Kim Hyun) She is meek and beaten down as Suk-hyun\\'s wife. The group supper gives her the strength to stand up to him.Cha Jin-ok (Kim Hee-jung) continued attempts to open the door and escape in order to locate and save her teen daughter repeatedly puts the group in jeopardy.Kim Su-yeongm ((HeoYool) is a small child (9 Years Old) who along with her brother Kim Yeong-su (Choi Go; 6-year-old) lost their father when he was attacked by a monster while attempting to repel down the side of the building to get them food.Son Hye-in (Kim Gook-hee) considers her Pomerania; Bom, like her child and continually carries it.Im Myung-sook (Lee Bong-ryun) devastated since losing her child when the baby\\'s stroller got loose and rolled into traffic.Choi Yoon-jae (Go Geon-Han) pretends to be kind to hide among the group from Sang-wook. But he is a human monster of another sort, a Child Predator.If Movies in the horror genre are your thing then this will likely fit the bill. The monsters were definitely scary and horrific and the fact that the people turn into monsters was in and of itself frightening . That type of transformation was reminiscent of the American movie \"The Thing\" though only vaguely so. It was interesting the way the people both had to work together while not completely trusting each other to be able to make it through. I liked that there was that central character, the teenage boy, and that he was unique and that he had the monster in him yet was largely able to control it. The series was well paced throughout most of it until towards the end when it got a little chaotic and felt like a lot of people were dying very rapidly. There were also aspects that were not well explained such as why the fire fighter character was suddenly with the military at the very end. The fact that she was working with them had been revealed earlier but it did not seem like she had given them what they wanted enough that she would\\'ve been able to join them completely. The gangster guy was very different in the television series than in the webtoon where he was more of a goofy character and much more likable. For the most part they stuck to the webtoon enough that it was clear that it was made based on it and yet deviated enough to make it work in the television format. They left it open for more seasons as everything was not wrapped up and in the fact there is additional story line in the webtoon indicates that there is story left for more episodes to the series or another season. I\\'m not sure why they decided to only do 10 episodes, 16 or more episodes would have allowed for a more complete telling of the story.',\n",
       "   \"So bad that you will fall asleep. Is so slow, bad cgi, bad korean show. All the korean show are over acting. And i don't know why imdb now is forcing to write a review longer. It sucks.\",\n",
       "   'Imagine the most miserable, unlikeable people on earth stuck in a residential building while random monsters go around with zero explanation.The monsters are pretty cool but the characters kill it. There is zero reason to give a flying crap about a single one of them. Every one is nasty for no reason. The stupid dancer runt, the crazy lady, the incel loser. Who wants to look at these imbeciles.Pass.',\n",
       "   \"The trailer had me hooked, and I was looking forward to this. The show is visually great, IMO. There's a decent amount of CGI that's hit/miss but various practical visual effects were done really well. The show is very colorful for almost 10 episodes of scenes trapped inside a building. The music was good too, minus the repetitive Imagine Dragons song. So if you like to enjoy stuff like that, give this a shot.\\nOne of things that's a plus about Korean movies and shows in general is that they easily blend genres. They make you get so invested into the characters in thrillers/horrors that the genre also becomes emotional - in a good way. Sweet Home has A LOT of characters but it takes time to get invested. But since it's a tv show and since there were so many people, i think it's okay to consume that much time.\\nThe monsters too, are very different from each other, unlike what we'd have seen in most zombie-type movies, they too had different personalities.\\nThe story though, was a slight let-down for me, I personally found that there were inconsistencies which breaks the suspense/tension/sense of urgency. I felt that there were several questions that were left unanswered towards the end of the show, which was also a let down, but maybe that's just me. Will there be an S2? Will they answer all those questions? I don't know, and the show doesn't end in a way that would make me wait in anticipation for S2 and for those answers.

First seven episodes are survival horror and the last 3 are straight up Game of Thrones/Walking Dead if you know what I mean. It just gets dark, gruesome and sad really quick.What I liked the most about this series is that it isn't the usual stuff. It's like a mix of 21 days later, meets resident evil, meets the last of us meets Marvel comics. It has a lot of good themes going for it that makes it worth watching if any of the above appeal to you.I will say that watching this it seemed like a single season was good enough.

I like the idea of how the humans are turning and being affected in different ways by this I guess you may call it possession.Unfortunately the execution makes it all feel completely fake. It's not just the CGI that makes it look fake. It's also how the transformation happens, how people act and even the changes themselves.Just to give a quick example on why this feels fake. Even though it isn't said when exactly it's happening towards the end of the first season we can see it starting to snow. So it plays around late autumn and early winter. This means usually it's rather cold outside. Except for one comment made by a kid no one ever refers to it being cold outside or how winter and snow may affect them. Winter in an apocalyptical event is usually a pretty serious issue. Here it's not even considered.In general food and water seem to be just some minor inconvenience that are also only mentioned once and then never again.The show is focused on human interaction and drama and unfortunately fails there too as the characters aren't feeling real for the most part and I'd call them one-dimensional.Towards the end of season one they also go for a very big cliché which is often found in zombie movies and honestly it's just not believable. In addition early on the monsters are established as a considerable threat. However the show shifts the focus away from the threat of the monsters and suddenly they barely make any appearances and are only a nuisance instead of an actual threat. You got to have your human drama...One more thing that really bothered me, was that throughout the whole season we stay in that one big apartment building. I still know nothing about how that building is even structured. We're jumping around between places within the building and often (especially in later episodes) it's not clear where the characters actually are within the building. And btw. with all the destruction going on there apparently was no real issue with getting electricity and that especially is not really believable.Honestly I wanted to like the show and I watched through season one within one week. Throughout it my rating was constantly going up and down between 3/10 and 7/10 because it has a few good scenes. Unfortunately looking at the overall result and also considering the poor choice and placement of the soundtrack at times I can't rate it higher.\",\n",

The second half starts to go down hill and gets very long winded with far less monsters and gore and more long, drawn out drama. By the end, it's more drama than anything. So I would rate the second half more of a 5 or 6/10. The premise is that people are turning into all sorts of monsters....no monster ever the same and at first there is no known cause for it. This show follows the survivors and monsters stuck in a very large apartment building. As the show moves on, you realize it's not an infectious disease like with zombies, but I won't say more.

(well except for some of the portrayals, that woman clearly going crazy with the virus at the start giving the poor guard the rotten fish annoyed me to no end)Now we get to a little bit of the problems though.The series doesn't give time to let things breathe, the way things go in the series it's a VERY fast ride through the plot from beginning to end and in that quickness, there's a lack of needed connection for certain characters, leaving emotional deaths to be less than thrilling and the eventual end to be kind of anticlimactic.I would love to see more of this universe even though the manhua as (as far as I know) finished.In itself, it's a fun little zombie movie with some original ideas, while they're zombies they are also strange monsters too depending on who/what they were before they were infected. That's what drew me to the series in the first place and it's a fantastic story to see more of.All in all the only reason this isn't 10/10 is that quick rush to the end. If they'd let the story build a bit more, have the heroes at a half way point and let this move into a season 2 I think it would be a perfect series.But aside from that, it's fantastic.As always (without very few notable exceptions) the netflix dub is atrocious and I suggest watching this on original language with subs if you don't speak Korean, the VA's in it are terrible in English and like most things these days dubbed into English, I avoid that like the plague.\",\n",

The actors/actresses are good for the most part, though there is a disconnect where some characters are super emotive and over the top and others and barely responsive given the situation. The one thing that I thought could have been better were the effects. While I understand that it is a lower-budget show, it's just that a lot of the CG, especially the monsters, felt out of place. Some of the CG looks pretty good, other CG not so much, but it just doesn't really mesh well together.

There is no some superficial glamour, no model like characters, but humans you can relate to and like. Story is quite interesting and has deeper layers than it looks on first sight.

I agree, I did not like it at first and I thought about it like a dark comedy but it develop into something serious, especially when you like all the characters. People, please, chill out and give it a try. Support new ideas instead of bashing on it with weak reviews. I think it's a 8.3 but I'll rate it a 10 to help with the ratings because it will turn away people, it's not bad of a tv show as how some people made it to be. I already binged 9 episodes in 2 days. Good stuff, chill out please.\",\n",

However the story is all over the place, so I agree with everyone who says it starts well but gets boring because of slow pacing and disjointed story telling. It's hard to follow also cause the characters all look the same and the korean names dont help, everyone is like Jun Jin Jon, Kwon bun bam, cin ciun lan, who the hell remembers that. And yes the CGI is that of a low budget straight to dvd movie, but if they paid a bit more attention to crafting a better structured story I would have excused it. In the end disappointing.\",\n",

The characters were annoying, yes, but they grew on me. Many dialogues and reactions seemed rather stupid, but they leaded to some great scenes. This series has a nice atmosphere, beautiful actors with lots of charisma. I liked the soundtrack and the CGI (yes, I do!). My biggest issue was the storytelling. They told too many stories at the same time. You want to know what happens to a certain character, but you have to wait, because other stories get in the way. I would have preferred it, if they finished one story arc and then moved on. I wasn't bothered by this kind of storytelling that much later on, when the series progressed. Most likely because the characters grew on me, and I was equally invested in everyone of them. To make it short: interesting survival/zombie/monster plot with annoying characters who became less annoying the more you know about them, decent CGI, decent music, some very good coloring and atmosphere. Some very good directing, some very bad directing and yeah ... Could have been better, but they did a good job most of the time. Some scenes were really bad, some were brilliant. Sometimes the action was incredible, sometimes it looked cheap or they just skipped a scene so you didn't even know what happened. It is, what it is.

I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn't as good.

The door was open and they held her back???( I could see that plotline a mile away because THIS is KDRAMA. This is train to busan all over again when the grandma opened the door. ) I can\\'t believe they had literally noone to keep an eye on her after her 1st attempt. Who\\'s stupid enough to let her off completely without 2nd thought? Oh another thing, the bish was not punished for her action. Instead, they had characters be like \"oh, no her daughter\\'s dead.\" Ya, well, what about the solider who died unnecessarily trying to save her? (ya, they don\\'t talk about it.) Tbh, they should have the mother try to rescue her daughter to give her some closure. and wth was her daughter doing outside anyway with all those mosnters? how did she make it that far? makes no sense.\\noh last thing, i hate seeing that actor in the wheelchair. he\\'s everywhereeeeeeeee. i\\'m tired so seeing the same face again and again.',\n",

It was like taking a breath of clean mountain air.Very original, great atmosphere, great characters, great cinematography, great pace, great action, dialogue, I have nothing to complain about at all... it was much more enjoyable than anything Hollywood made in recent years.I will definitely be looking for more Korean movies/TV shows now.',\n",

Probably Koreans will say this is not that Korean, that it is a westernized version. I'm Hungarian so viewing this series it seemed very Asian to me. The interaction, the greetings, the politeness and manner, relationships between characters are very Asian. For example the relationship between the guy with the sword and the bass player girl (I'm sorry but the names were really difficult to me to know) is just a platonic love and then the guy dies. In a western film there would have been at least kissing but more likely sex. Or the long takes on the meaningful gazes of the characters.In the first couple episodes the monsters are excellent, but around the 7-8 th episode it dies down the story becomes more drama driven. The music was mixed, it tried to have classical and modern pieces alike. They seem to have bought the Warriors Imagine Dragons song (which I'm sure was pretty expensive) so they overplayed it.\\nYeah I get it, the real monsters are the humans losing their humanity in this series, but that took away the horror part too fast.There are some illogical parts or plot holes like monsters don't die. But the first one (the women that wants to kill Hyun-Su) dies directly after being her faced kicked into pulp and after that several monsters are killed of.Overall a really good experience and it kept me watching but to be honest it was getting more predictable and flat nearing the end.\",\n",

Also some of the deaths (in some cases they might come back) of characters were just unnecessary and not logical at all. Also when the gang showed up they were a way over-the-top evil as well. I would rather liked to have seen more of trauma and how monsters are the image of everybody dealing with this. But I complain too much. It is well shot and acted most of the time, there is a good score and the CGI is mostly well, sometimes a little cheap, but it is a TV-show. It does not bother me. Also the kid actors were good as far as I can tell, not being a native speaker. What is sometimes bothering me a little bit is the rules of this world. Apparently you cannot kill the monsters but they still attack them with fire and so on. Why? They should rather trap them somewhere or something. People don't have to die fighting a thing they can't kill (the elevator-fire scene). But as I said, overall a good watch. Let's hope there is more of psychology and less of bang-bang kill (probably not).\",\n",

There were some interesting background stories which made up for it, but still, I think maybe some more monsters could have appeared in order to fill the space. I didn't like that some scenes were just cut off. For example: two characters were struggling with a monster, one of them was willing to sacrifice himself (if necessary), so the other character could go and help the others. The camera goes with the 2nd guy and the other one is left alone with the monster. The 2nd guy then does, what he has to do and later on the first guy joins the group. As if nothing had happened before. I would have expected to see some details about how he managed to get away and get rid of the monster he was fighting against. I have the same problem with the end. The main character gets shot at and he is badly injured, then all of the sudden he is in a back of a car. I would have liked to see how he managed to get into the car.

The best monsters and set-pieces are delivered up-front, while we are getting more character focuses later on. This by itself wouldn't have been bad, since the human stories are good ones and the investment in the peoples fates is definitely there, but the show really struggles to move the plot along after things settle. The writers really struggle to give people something to do and random side quests pop-up that are almost immediately dropped after an anti-climatic resolution. There is also a weird editing structure at place I never got used to, where the show would give us flashbacks to past conversations or basically extended versions of prior scenes where something was said or done, that only becomes immediately relevant after the flashback. There seems to be no faith in the audience to keep track of character motivations and relationships over multiple episodes.\\nAlso rules are very inconsistent, first it's a big deal that monsters can't be killed, plenty of monsters are killed. Wearing headphones should alert you to monsters presence, people with headphones get jumped by monsters all the time and so on...Lastly, it becomes a pity party quite often, I was worried the besieged apartment building would sink in the lake of tears generated by the people trapped inside. It is standard for Asian cinema, but still a bit too much some times.That sound overly negative, but make no mistakes, the show is good overall, you come for the monsters, you stay for the survivors. The creature design is great throughout, the CGI holds up most of the time (whit a couple of bad shots, mainly involving a hulking monstrosity) and the practical effects are top notch like the overall production value. If we get a second season I hope the overall plot is paced much better and the emotions will be dialed back a bit\",\n",
       "   'I settle back to watch a Korean webtoon based apocalyptic horror TV series (released on Netflix on December 18, 2020) and confusedly hear the lead in score of \"Dies irae\" (which is something like a 17th century Latin based Requiem Mass). Not a Korean score - oh wait... it is... arranged by Cho Yoon Jung? So, this is why I watch foreign films. It broadens my perspective.I have low expectations in regard to this particular genre - but, I am pleasantly surprised, entertained and impressed.There is some very good acting in some well written and directed roles. For example, Lee Do-hyun as Lee Eun-hyuk the accepted leader of a building\\'s survivors.\\nAnother example, Lee Si-young as Seo Yi-kyung, a former firefighter.\\nI could list a dozen more.A problem are the character roles thrown in for comedic relief which are horribly conceived and delivered. If those roles had been rewritten as dramatic roles the series would have been better. The child roles were atrocious. For some reason the children typically shouted their dialogue.I think I am not familiar with Korean culture and perhaps I do not understand the acting. For example, when the characters would do a hysterical sequence it always came across as whiny-screaming (I listened with Korean audio and English subtitles). Perhaps that is how individuals act hysterically in Korea? Maybe I should listen to the English actors dub and see if that comes across better for an American?Regardless, the series is surprisingly entertaining and I think individuals who enjoy this genre will enjoy Sweet Home.',\n",
       "   \"I couldn't get into this show until the second episode, and the CGI is awful. However, starting with the second episode, this show becomes quite gripping. There is a particularly horrific scene in which a child is killed in front of her mother. The actress who plays the mother of the child deserves an award for her amazing performance. Part of what makes this show riveting is that it's not afraid to put characters who are children in peril and the show makes you genuinely afraid that a child could be killed. Also, it's refreshing that the evil creatures are monsters for a change instead of zombies. However, I have to deduct a point for a boring first episode and another point for awful CGI.\",\n",

       "   'I would rate this lower, but it was at least a fun show to watch. Sweet Home is a Netflix series based on the famous Webtoon \\'Sweet Home\\'. Now I haven\\'t finished reading the Webtoon, but from what I have read it is much better than this. From the same creator as \\'Bastard\\', one of my favourite Web series, it\\'s hard to see his work being vandalised with this \"bastardised\" live adaptation.Now it isn\\'t all bad, the show is at least fun and creative. The start of the show was good for the most part, but already from the start the monsters looked a bit silly, and the acting was oddly overdone. Then we start to see a bit of divergence in storytelling compared to its source material; while not always a bad thing, with The Shining being one of my favourite movies - which diverged so much from the book, this is another good example of \"if it isn\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\". The show introduces monsters with barely any explanation of their backstories or the reason they are the way they are. This is annoying as the manhwa clearly illustrates each character and monster and their purpose and reasoning for existing. This gets you invested and explains the weirdness of what\\'s going on. While they do this with some monsters, some of the weirder ones like the charger from \"Left4Dead 2\" who always says \"protein\" or the Usain Bolt zombie having 0 explanation coke across as the dumbest designs in the whole show, despite being the most intensely interesting ones in the book.It doesn\\'t help not explaining things, but it gets worse with how disjointed scenes are. I genuinely felt like I was accidentally skipping episodes with how shitty the overall pacing, where you have one character being chased down being spliced next to him being safe. It leaves me more confused than I need to be. What\\'s worse is that they also fill in the rushed pacing with blank stares and drawn out scenes that in the manhwa existed for a page usually. There are some key moments in the book that were handled so well because of the tension created, but in the Netflix adaptation scenes would be spliced with non-essential scenes that would completely break up the flow and tension.The overall feeling of emptiness, tension, sadness, horror that was created by the book is completely ruined by the over-dramatic acting and the poorly slapped on \"Imagine Dragons Warriors\" song that wouldn\\'t stop playing. With scenes dragged out, dumb looking monsters, disjointed script writing, and what felt like a completely different story being screwed onto the ending, I can\\'t see why you\\'d want to waste your time with this. It\\'s fun, but in the mindless-bed-ridden-mood kinda way.',\n",
       "   'I wanted to watch something to keep me entertained, and this definitely kept me entertained. I finished all 10 episodes in two days. Some people will nitpick every little flaws but I loved the characters, the action and the special effects. If you\\'re into long drawn out storyline with character development, just stick with the walking dead, but if you\\'re into a good apocalyptic action shows/movies, then this may be for you. You may also want to check out \"Kingdom\" (Korean zombie action drama). Very good!\\nI\\'m really hoping for a second season to \"Sweet Home\"!',\n",
       "   'I\\'ll start off by saying that I\\'d never even heard of the source material going into this show, so everything I say is based strictly on the 10 episodes released thus far. In a nutshell, Sweet Home is best enjoyed with your brain turned half way between off and on.I\\'ll start off with the positives1) I was never bored while watching Sweet Home - I feel like this is a show about moments than an complex story. First and foremost, a show needs to be entertaining, and the writers, and performers, did a good enough job of keeping me entertained and interested from episode to episode.2) Some of the monster designs were spectacular - I love nothing more than seeing practical effects and make-up bring monsters to life. While some of the monsters suffer from terrible CGI being used to bring them to life, some of the designs really stood out as something else.3) There are some moments of genuine emotion - In the earlier episodes, there were some moments that legitimately had me feeling sympathy for the characters, which is incredibly important for making me care about them.Now for the negatives1) Incredibly confusing scene to scene editing - there are scenes in Sweet Home that were literally seconds apart that had me asking myself \"did I black out for a few minutes or something?\". With out spoiling things, characters go from having a conversation in one scene, to on the verge of death from a medical complication in the very next scene. In another scene a character is fighting a monster, the focus shifts to another scene, and that same character just shows up later, no explanation of how they escaped their situation. In some episodes it literally feels like there are scenes missing.2) Bewildering musical choices -The original score is really solid, and fits well (overall) with the show. However, they must have paid through the nose for that Imagine Dragons song, because it gets used a lot. There was even a very emotional scene that was ruined because they slapped this song over the scene for seemingly no reason.3) Seemingly random character deaths - Again, I haven\\'t read the source material, but I can\\'t imagine some of the characters died the same way as they did in the show. I understand that, realistically, people would seemingly die at random in a situation like this, but it doesn\\'t make for the best story. Typically in a story, a major character is killed at the end of their arc or to build emotion/hatred towards a villain. There were two pretty quick major character deaths in the show that left me more baffled than angry at the person who killed them. If I\\'m left confused and underwhelmed by a major character death, then you\\'ve more or less killed them off for nothing.4)Chekhov\\'s gun... or monster - without spoilers, there is a monster that appears to be unique because it acts differently from the other monsters that are simply filled with the urge to kill without reason. In fact this monster goes out of its way to help a character. However the reasons for this monster\\'s difference were left unexplored. It sort of left me feeling like the rule of Chekhov\\'s gun had been broken. If you\\'re not going to explore something unique you\\'ve introduced, just leave it out altogether.5) Terrible pacing, in general - I feel like this was due to the writers wanting to reach a certain point of the source material by the 10th episode, while still fitting as many of the scenes and moments from the source material in as possible. I think they would have been better off either taking things a little more slowly, or leaving some parts out. Nothing kills a story faster than bad pacing, and this show has some of the worse I\\'ve ever seen.To sum up, despite my negative sounding review, I actually really enjoyed watching Sweet Home (when I didn\\'t think too much about it), and I might even give it a second watch down the line. I\\'m interested to see if, and how, the story continues - they clearly left some cliffhangers in there. I\\'d really like to see what to world of Sweet Home is like outside of that one apartment building.',\n",

WIth this I mean, I really 'd feel better if there was more monster action as the drama, the interpersonal relationships, crimi, etc aren't among the things that provoke interest in me, but, well, different people, different points of view. You can check out the series on Netflix, and if you like the first 2-3 episodes, then you'd like the rest, too.

Distinct main characters\\n3. Decent story\\n4. Very interesting creature design, good variety in that you never know what monstrocity an \"infected\" person will turn into.Cons:\\n1. Main character\\'s go to response for a question or statement being a stunned, silent stare, lasting 10, 15 seconds at times.\\n2. People are way too emotional than they ought to be, and crying too much. Scenes get dragged out, trying too hard to elicit an emotional response.\\n3. Monster threat level could be cranked up a few notches. I was more worried at a later point in time when our group of survivor is facing a different type of threat. Much more unpredictable and way more damaging than the monsters.',\n",

Korean movies are generally good or excellent.So about this show:\\nA few good/excellent early episode, but it turns into a mashed potato.\\nSome CG works are hokey, but creatures and special effects in the show are generally good or great.It follows the Shonen Japanese anime/manage trope.

I have to agree with them. Far too much time is spent showing us flashbacks. We don\\'t need \"origin\" stories as the characters are already in a dire situation that\\'s going to change their personality going forward. What we need are explanations of why certain events are happening now, why certain monsters seemingly appear from nowhere and a bit more time spent showing us character interactions in the here-and-now.The soundtrack is good.

       "   'This show is incredibly fun to watch. The atmosphere is compelling, it follows a lot of familiar (and beloved) tropes while still introducing unique spins on things, and the acting is solid. There are incredibly frustrating aspects to the show, which I assume is a result of adapting a webtoon. For example, a webtoon panel might have someone staring while a fight is going on, but in the show it comes across as ridiculous because they just stare into space for 30 seconds at a time. It gets to a point where you\\'re genuinely in awe any of these people have survived. It\\'s a bit campy--a monster screaming \"PROTEIN\" is really hard to take seriously especially within a show that takes itself very seriously.I\\'d never read the webtoon before watching. I did pick it up after finishing the show and I think it explains why the show feels awkward at times. The webtoon has a lot more levity and doesn\\'t take itself as seriously. There\\'s a lot of humor to break up the tension and make characters likeable. The show is so determined to be gritty and realistic that it gives itself no space for suspension of disbelief. Again, a monster screaming about protein feels wildly out of place in the show but suits the webtoon.If you go into the show without expecting it to perfectly match the webtoon and are able to take it as it is, you\\'ll have fun. It\\'s a love it or hate it kind of show and I think approaching it as a campy monster show will set expectations more appropriately. A lot of reviewers said to give it 3 episodes to kick in, but expecting anyone to invest 3 hours before a show picks up is unreasonable. If you like the first episode, you\\'ll probably like the whole show and vice versa.',\n",

At first it was a bit overwhelming, being introduced to so many characters, but I really like getting to know each and every one of them. Almost none of the characters nor scenes bored me.The concept of the show is pretty captivating. People are turning into monsters left and right, and one doesn't know when someone will turn. The residents of a certain building construct a small society in order to protect themselves, and shenanigans ensue.\\nI do feel like the show could be a bit confusing at times, not showing us or not finishing showing us what someone was doing or what is going on with them. It's still not very clear exactly how someone turns into a monster, so I wish the show was clearer on that. I also do wish we got to delve into more of some characters, since they were great, but there were so many of them. But I suppose there was only a certain amount of time for everything, and though I would've liked the season or the episodes to be longer to clarify the plot more and explore the characters more, I feel like the show still did good enough. Either way, that just leaves space for more clarity and character background and development next season, which I really hope will come.This show made me think a lot (What's to come next? Who can be trusted? Who's the real monster here? Will they turn into one?), and it did make me feel pain at certain points.

The portrayal of the main character is awful. In the show he is more like a side character, he doesn't have any personality, development or a connection with any other character, they completely changed him.2. They introduce characters that didn't existed before (they had more screen time than the main character) and removed characters that were essential for the story on the web comic.3. The story is so rushed that it doesn't have any impact when a character dies.4. The story is so different to the original one, i felt like I was watching the walking dead.5. There are a lot of annoying characters that don't add anything to the plot (they're just there).6. Jisu is a very important character on the webtoon (she is one of the main ones) but here she is not (just like hyun), I was very disappointed by this.7. Also the music doesn't fit the atmosphere of some of the scenes. I remember that in a scene with Hyun that's supposed to be scary or intense they put a rap, like... what?

       "   'I enjoyed this adaption of the webtoon but, I wish they would have followed the webtoon a bit more. The deaths of Wook and Yuri did not seem right. Though they could be supposed deaths since at the end it showed Wook in the car, but that could have been the evil infected who turned into a gooey like substance who took over his body. The romance between Jae-heon and Ji soo seemed weird to me too, but I do not know if the show followed the same ages as the webtoon. The meaningless deaths of Hyuk and a couple of others just made me upset after reading the webtoon. I am happy that they could continue the show though but, since the webtoon is over and has a completely different direction the creators will have to come up with brand new ideas. Hyun in this show mentioned in other reviews does seem more like a side character to me. While reading the webtoon I could see his growth and his fight with desire. Still overall people who have read the webtoon should watch the show. Even though it is different, the show gives you a new perspective on the series and hiw things could have happened. Though some changes might make you mad, think of it as an adaption and at least hiw the show ends there can be more to the story because the webtoon may never have another part. I have noticed the author of Sweet Home writes stories that are usually straight to the point and short. If you have not read the webtoon I ask you to read it to understand how the story was originally written. I really wish other stories by this author would be turned into a live action.',\n",
       "   \"This is one fascinating watch. The show is entirely carried by its strong premise: a band of survivors hunkers down in an apartment complex while the people outside are turning into monsters.There are a couple things to like: the monsters are truly gross and grotesque and the animations are surprisingly good for a TV show. Cinematography and the use of colors can be quite beautiful, and some characters are quite interesting (albeit they are in the minority).Here's what I don't like and why I would not recommend this show: scenes are drawn out with people just staring into nothingness, and the show tries to cheaply evoke emotions in melodramatic ways like overtly and unduly zooming in on distressed people's faces. People often don't react to or even acknowledge the things that are happening around them, which at times results in truly jarring situations that do not make any sense at all. Also, there is a serious problem with editing. Sometimes there is almost no context to what is happening on screen, like a plan carried out that was not discussed beforehand, making the viewer guessing in a frustrating way.At the end of the day, I do enjoy watching Sweet Home, because this show is unlike any other show I've seen before. But you have to be willing to embrace the bizareness of it all.\",\n",
       "   \"I have no clue what my measly opinion is worth - here it is anyway:The animation and live action blend needed some work, however, I thought after the first few episodes it got MUCH BETTER - I enjoyed the blend even when the effects weren't high quality. I felt it was artistic.The storyline had me hooked. I ended up invested in many of the characters, including the secondary characters - for me that's tough to do. At first I was afraid the show would shy away from certain themes - heavens to betsy was I wrong. They didn't pull the punches or baby us through the drama. This seriously touched me. I'm raving about it.There are several interesting story lines that I hope they unravel in season 2 - fantastic take on monster drama (monsdrama) - and I'm on the edge of my seat for the next season.

In the series, there is no explanation why they turned into monsters, why Hyun able to resist his desire, why Mr. An and Ji Su who had nosebleed seems to be fine and were not quarantined?, there is almost no monster rather than hulk outside the building making me wonder \"why didnt they just go?\", security guard, runner and spider guy were too weak, literally weird character development, weak bad guys, and literally different ending.

The makeup is great with realistic scenes and the monsters CGI are a blend of new animation and classic effects.

It still managed to stay a solid good show until the end but the drop in quality is noticeable especially between the 1st and the rest of the episodes.

       "   'I\\'ve read the webtoon this was based on, and it was amazing. However, they\\'ve changed certain elements of the original story. Some of the characters are different - either different gender, different personality, different back story, different relationships, new characters and missing characters, to name a few.The show also deviates from the original story line despite the crux of it being the same. Now, this is an issue because some of the crucial parts of the original webtoon which makes us, as viewers, understand each character\\'s motives and choices are non-existent in the show. The little backstory that they give us just feels like filler content without actual consequence. My opinion of the show when compared to the original webtoon, is that it is disappointing.However, let\\'s judge this as a show of its own:The visuals look great but also terrible. The art feels like they have a good VFX team behind it, but the direction of the scenes with heavy use of the CGI just feels so low-budget. It kills the pseudo realism that the show could have portrayed.The soundtrack is fine, but the songs that they play during some of the action sequences feel so out of place. It does not fit the vibe of the show or the premise that has been set. The music feels like an attempt at overcompensating for the show\\'s inadequacies elsewhere.The script is all over the place with terrible pacing, and if you have not read the webtoon before, you\\'re left confused and hanging at certain times. It\\'s not coherent. The characters are unexpectedly helpless in a situation where they could actually do something, and are sometimes the opposite. Without spoiling much, you\\'ll find yourself at times pulling at your hair wondering why these characters made such absurd choices. Some choices just make no sense other than, it was the \"edgier\" choice. You don\\'t even root for or think of the primary protagonist as the protagonist of the show.The only good thing this show has going for it is how well the acting is. I can\\'t say much else about this. The show just feels like it had a lot of potential but fell below that quite hard.As a standalone show, I would give it a 6, but as a show based on the original webtoon, it\\'s probably a 3 or a 4 for me.In conclusion, due to the show\\'s terrible pacing and storytelling, it feels like a tribute or a homage to the original webtoon. However, as a fan, I am terribly disappointed in how they\\'ve butchered something so amazing.\\nTL;DR Incoherent plot, terrible pacing, poor direction of the visuals.',\n",

What makes the show not work for me are the performances of the actors and theses monsters themselves. Honestly, you don't feel too much for this cast, 3 of the actors look like they either in a constant state or confusion or worry even when nothing is happening. There are a few sad moments but they're easily forgotten when a monster that looks like it belongs in a haunted house shows up and gets in a 1-1 with imagine dragons playing the background. Also can we talk about that?? IMAGINE DRAGONS. LIKE 4 TIMES, it was surprising choice the first time but became a joke as it diluted the intensity of serious moments.Overall: The show isn't bad, just not the most enthralling. The characters aren't the most engaging other than the gangster and he says maybe a sentence an episode.

The slightly naff K-pop (Sorry if you're a fan) had started to be toned down (by episode 3) and the ending to the series felt like you'd be taken on a real emotional ride with the comic book, almost Scott Pilgrim esque feel, had been completely eradicated.

If you're like me, you'll know that they changed a lot of things, drastically. The first complaint I have is how little we get to see Hyun. I feel like the comic focused on him a whole lot more, and we also got to see his 'monster' way more frequently. The adaptation should've more on him than the rest of the group. On the other hand, I can see that if they focus on the group more, then it would strengthen the fact that Hyun is a loner, but I don't exactly like that. The ending drastically changed, and I think it's a hit or miss for most people. They added in the military and so many more things, but I liked the simplicity of the comic. Also, the girl with the character development (the one who fell to her death at the end) isn't here, and it seems like she was replaced with another guy. Old man didn't get crushed by protein monster (that was huge in the comic, I'm surprised they didn't include that) and I think the romance is kinda bad. The woman and her dead child made me cry though, so I liked how they wrote her. Overall, I'm uncertain where they'll take this, but I'll keep my hopes up for now.\",\n",

But this show rushes through character introductions and has a really garish lighting scheme and Party City mask monsters. It looks like an 80s B movie, so if you're into that this might be for you but has none of the original horror. Moreover, it's a tonal nightmare with a random Imagine Dragons' song used as a recurring theme. The flashbacks extrapolate too much of Hyun's character arc in the first episodes which ruins a lot of the mystery about his character.

The directing, however, is absolutely horrendous.The pacing is horrible it seems as if they were trying to finish everything in one season, but were running out of time and then towards the end started upping the pace until it's impossible to follow what is going on. There are sudden shifts in pace and scenes seem completely disconnected. Lots of important plot points are completely skipped. It makes a lot of the important parts of the story seem unimportant and skips all of the struggles that helped build characterization.The plot diverges heavily from the original webtoon, as if someone explained the main plot points to them from a moving car and they did their best to reconstruct some context for the show. New characters are introduced which steal roles from existing characters which results in poor characterization and character development for them all. The main character is tossed to the wayside and they barely show his progress. Many new characters are introduced whose only purpose are to drive your blood pressure up and be irritating; Hyun-soo's younger sister is rude and disgusting to everyone, the side characters who live in the apartment do literally nothing but cry, get in the way, cower in a corner when someone strong shows up, and throw a hissy fit when things don't go their way. They contribute literally nothing.Bass girl has her role completely cannibalized and her roles given to the firefighter girl. She ends up being a minor character and spends most of the show being sad about her dead lover, and suddenly having appendicitis and needing surgery which is performed without anesthetics.Later when the prisoners show up, they spend time building up the leader who then immediately gets killed in an unimpressive way. The guy with similar powers to the main character randomly starts killing half the charactersIn the end all of the actual characters of importance are dead, so when they get captured and the firefighter (only iportant character left) turns on them, I felt no remorse.Also, monsters show up and cause issues in maybe 3 or 4 episodes. They aren't nearly as dangerous or scary as in the webtoon, and don't actually do anything. After going into the basement they only find one monster. Once they start fighting, only then do they see that there's actually tons of them, and they start using car beeps from pressing buttons on the keys to distract a monster. But they didn't show them collecting the keys or planning to do this so it seems completely out of place. Not too long after them driving through the basement and crashing, it cuts to another scene upstairs and the next episode they mention the basement is clear and from that point on it's clear, but they never show them killing the monsters. Then, they don't them planning or preparing to make it but they make a armored car pouring tons of resources into it, and drive it out and it immediately gets destroyed by the protein monster. This happens in a cutscene taking like 20 seconds.The series is full of decisions like this that ruin the flow and make it confusing. It doesn't make it fun to watch for someone who hasn't already read the webtoon. And if you have read it, you would be confused why they changed things so much and destroyed any storytelling. That just begs the question. Who is this for?\",\n",

This show was SO much fun, it doesn\\'t follow the same recipe of, destroy the head, destroy the being, one bite turns you etc. That\\' was SO refreshing, THIS is why I love watching Korean and Chinese dramas, I find more unique stories. Sure, there are tropes to be seen, but it\\'s not always the same over and over and this show is a great example. I am blown away that the ratings aren\\'t higher on this series. How tf does the walking dead have a higher score than this? I like the walking dead, I watched it, but, it\\'s certainly not unique and certainly not better than this.',\n",
       "   'This id consider an original so far got all different kind of monsters but yet it still has to do with a virus....i like the fact they took virus zombie to mutating monsters lookin like theyd be coming up from the bottom of hell instead... not really a zombie show id say but i love it',\n",
       "   \"I actually read the webtoon after watch the trailer of this series. It's so good that i couldn't stop reading until finish. Therefore, the high expectation to this netflix adaptation. It only took 1 episode to make me sum up that this is very bad. I know cinema and still graphics are different media, but this is just too far. I can imagine that if i haven't read the webtoon, I wouldn't finish the first episode. Bad CGI (the monsters are not scary at all and more like stop motion dolls), very bad acting and directing. And yeah, the background music is very annoying. I did fast forwarding through episode 1-9, and found that they even changed the story into the cheesy one, and again with bad acting.\"],\n",

       " '고요의 바다': [[\"Another good Korean show courtesy of Netflix. This one riffs heavily on the ALIEN trilogy but the story is engaging and fresh-feeling enough for that not to matter. Great to see some of the stars of SQUID GAME show up alongside KINGDOM's Doona Bae and of course nobody puts a foot wrong. Quality wise, it does rely on cliche at times and it's not quite up there with SQUID GAME, but then what is? This one's a slow-moving atmosphere piece with some unusual scenes and growing suspense as it goes on; the last couple of episodes are quite thrilling. I liked it a lot.\",\n",
       "   \"This eight part Korea science fiction series is set in a near future where events have led to almost total desertification of the Earth. Water is a treasured commodity. With this in the backdrop Captain Han Yun-Jae has been tasked with leading a mission to retrieve samples from an abandoned lunar base. Amongst the team is scientist Dr Song Ji-An. Dr Song's sister had been one of the base's staff that was lost in a 'radiation leak' five years previously. The mission, which was due to take twenty four hours, gets off to a bad start; a crash landing leaves the crew having to walk several miles on the moon with limited oxygen. Things don't get much better when they reach the station. It soon becomes clear that not everything they were told was true, there are plenty of hidden dangers, they have difficulty finding the samples and what they find appears to be dangerous; to make matters worse it would appear that they are not alone.I thought this was a pretty solid series. It might not have been the most original but it delivered plenty of tension throughout. It is science fiction but there are also good horror elements such as what happens when people come in contact with the strange 'Luna water'. The characters were the sort one would expect in such a series; the leader who insists on sticking to the mission even after things go wrong; one trying to learn what happened to a family member; one constantly complaining and one who can't quite be trusted to mention just a few. The cast is solid; most obviously Bae Doona, who always seems to impress, as Dr Song. The effects are pretty good even if science is often ignored... for example I never though characters were operating in one sixth of Earth gravity. There are some nice surprises and ultimately I enjoyed the series so would recommend it to fans of the genre; just be prepared to suspend your disbelief.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.\",\n",
       "   'One of the most agonizing efforts to watch not just one movie but a whole eight-episode series. Wanted to quit after the first two episodes. The South Korean scriptwriters threw together a whole mess of movie genres, cliches, and created an overlong, disjointed, unbelievable space disaster, thriller, espionage, medical horror television series that went beyond credibility. The one of the few reasons to watch this series is the star, Bae Doona, who came on the movie scene in the intriguing sci fi movie Cloud Atlas (2012). But the script writers with their poor dialogue and eclectic plot devices practically ruined a possibly decent movie. With way better editing, cutting two episodes, and focusing primarily on fewer characters, and a main plot outline, The Silent Sea might have been a credible sci fi movie worth watching. But a lot of what happens in this final product does not make sense and there is way too much going on. More is definitely not better here. Never to be watched again and re-experience a bewildering, convoluted, and unbelievable story.',\n",
       "   \"The Silent Sea got a solid production but that's more ore less the one and only positive aspect of the show. The story itself is a rather generic blend of well known stuff and the crew, like in so many shows and movies these days, behaves like, well, people where all brain functions are put on standby mode (I guess this is just mirroring the mental capacities of the writing staff or how much they use to write their stuff). On top, some of the physics and science stuff are, lets be tender, questionable. Cut down to a full length movie this may have worked better, but for a show there is not enough substance and too much filler time that drags that whole thing on and on. Just imagine Carpenter's masterpiece The Thing blown up to a 10 hour long tv show... Anyway, watchable, to a certain degree, but more or less you just get a warmed up and stale dish served.\",\n",
       "   'Korean Drama \"The Silent Sea\" is a decent attempt to create a post-apocalyptic drama with loads of suspense and thriller factors.And for sure, the drama keeps things edgy and suspenseful till the very last minute. The viewer is thrown straight away into the action, with the earth struggling to find water to support the needs of the population, and a scientist is forced to leave the planet. And there is a nudging feeling that something is off right up when the team lands on the moon and goes into the base. That feeling is maintained all throughout the story. In addition, the mystery that is formed and solved is well constructed, well presented, and perfectly paced. It gives small cheese bites throughout the episodes, and it concludes everything nicely in the final one.However, the drama leaves a lot of things out. The condition of the earth and the dystopian current situation is not well explained and just given as a fact rather than something that needs more exploration. The characters are also the losers of the mystery-thriller focused story. There are some flashbacks that indicate some short of past and personalities, but other than those, the characters are left as blank ones that were acting on based on their initial introductions. The CGI, moreover, were bad and almost ruined the atmosphere of the drama at times.On the other hand, the performances were top notch, as expected by top tier actors and actresses.So, overall, 7.5 out of 10.',\n",
       "   'The technology and space equipment on the moon was a cool setting. However there were some moments that were just left as luck - when Chief Han woke up after climbing down the ladder and the elevator shaft came up. When Dr. Song woke up in the infirmary after locking herself in the room as she throws up water. The doctor thinks Luna is an antidote.Dr. Song finding out that her sister who was the chief researcher illegally made human clones to test the lunar water.Then all the men died except for women and children. Not sure what happens in the end but a reporter narrates survivors were found. I was unsatisfied with the ending. The earth is running out of water and global warming has dried up the world. Interesting premise but I wanted more development to the story.',\n",
       "   \"In a time of global drought. An infinite supply of liquid unobtainium is discovered on the moon that could save mankind (or at least the nasty social elites) if only it can be rendered non-lethal for human consumption. Neither the physics nor the biology make any sense, so calling this 'science' fiction is a bit of a stretch (despite the incessant stream of clichés usually associated with the genre such as a crash landing leaving the spaceship dangling on the edge of a precipice, a mysterious monster that no one ever gets a good look at, constant running up and down corridors looking worried and/or frightened, etc). The plot drifts from the implausible to the ridiculous when the true nature of the monster is revealed (a big letdown) and the final scenes are so ludicrous that the entire story could have simply been a guilt-induced fever dream as po-faced Song Ji-an (Bae Doona ) stares out the window at the barren lunar landscape. The cast is fine in relatively undemanding roles and some of the moon imagery is good (although marred as usual by the filmmakers' insistence at including sounds in a vacuum). Despite an interesting initial premise and some effective tension building in the first few episodes 'The Silent Sea' is an incoherent and uninteresting entry in the 'abandoned space-base' sci-fi sub-genre and not really worth eight hours of couch-time. I find it hard to believe that anyone would care enough about the story or the characters to warrant a second season.\",\n",

       "   \"Probably the most thirsty show on Netflix.A new South Korean space-travel thriller on Netflix. The cast got many familiar faces, so I was pretty excited for this show.Sadly I think this was a generic sci-fi with a lot of predictable plot points. The more I watched, the more I was sure of what the show was heading towards. I wasn't surprised much when certain twists got revealed. Even worse, some subplots felt unnecessary and also some visual scenes didn't create that much impact.The characters were also generic. They all got backgrounds that I have seen countless times before. Even so I don't think they have enough for me to invest in their outcomes.Overall, the show got a unique concept, but the execution was subpar. 5.5-6/10.\",\n",
       "   \"Following their consecutive triumphs in a myriad of genres & styles in the recent past; Koreans have now finally decided to take the initiative into this fairly newer ground i.e. Sci-fi/Space. On a concept level, this was a terrific attempt, a fascinating idea indeed. If only the execution was able to correspond accordingly, this could have resulted in something else entirely!The budget was sufficient as were the available resources. There were absolutely no problems whatsoever regarding how it looked and felt. The Cinematography, the Sound, the all-around production is nothing but a testimony to my aforesaid statement. Performances too satisfied the prerequisites! Albeit, the characterization leaves a much bigger room for improvement.The same goes for the Screenplay as well. Which was, by and large, an uninteresting and uneventful affair. All thanks to its dismal pace; which should have had better consistency and nourishment. As you can probably tell by now, the primary issue isn't with the idea or the particular way it is conceptualized; it is more about the implementation, which failed to take advantage of its much broader potential in the end.While, on one hand, I do praise the creators for their covetous and pragmatic intents; on the other hand, I don't see this getting much of a success. Let's just say, I fear, in the majority of cases, people's exact expectations wouldn't be met!\",\n",
       "   'The Silent Sea acts as a procedural sci-fi drama, but in reality, feels like a superslow cosplay event.The science part in \"science fiction\" is mutilated by the script. They didn\\'t hire at least a university professor to brief them on how space works (this hits hard in the first and especially the last episode). This heavily undermines the overall investment of the viewer, since so many things make absolutely no sense. Even the basics of a space mission are all over the place, random people show up carrying random items (essential to the plot), the spacecraft feels like a low-cost with free seating. Even our main group is basically sent on a suicide mission with zero information and preparation whatsoever. And in a world where space travel is more accessible, the existence of such an empty space base with important stuff is barely believable.There is no planning, problem-solving, actual management, or allocation of responsibilities. People in space suits act like 15-year-olds and make stupid decisions after stupid decisions. This is where the procedural part comes in since we are shown everything that happens, whenever someone discusses something, goes somewhere, does something. From time to time such scenes are used for exposition, but all the character stuff is a background to the moving around the facility. Only two people have at least cardboard basic characteristics and sort-of-backstories. Timeflow is also messed up, I\\'m not sure, but the subtitles said something about a 24-hr mission, and since nobody is seen sleeping or eating during 8 episodes, I assume this is the case. Although I don\\'t know how can you reach the Moon in 24 hours, this is the future, right. Again, adding to the nonsensical nature of the \"science\" part, the base didn\\'t make any sense at all. It\\'s huge, yet it held only around 100 people, it looks and feels like it has no purpose, just huge empty halls of empty.I can\\'t discuss the main plot point without going into spoilers though, so I won\\'t. Although I was able to play a fun game just by counting things that were introduced and then abandoned right away. Like the elevator situation, the corporate espionage plot, the space company director/deputy doctor motivations.Acting-wise nobody tried too hard, yet the script was as undemanding as possible, so no real effort was necessary. I got some enjoyment from the static face of the main female lead. I really did like that she has no visible emotions whatsoever, I\\'m not even kidding. There were a couple of likable people on the mission, but not because they were special in any way, but because they acted less like naughty children than anyone else.If you get past ep. 1, you will probably finish it just to see how it ends (microspoiler - there is no satisfying end to season 1). Also, there were probably some alterations done since ep. 7 is around 10 minutes shorter than all the other ones.The Silent Sea can be endured, even with all the abovementioned things + obligatory tearjerking. But you have to prepare yourself for one important thing - the pacing. It never changes. The show is moving at a constant pace. Even during action scenes.I\\'m not sure I can recommend this to a specific audience, sci-fi fans will get confused by this new Space, general audiences will not survive ep. 1. So I guess I cannot recommend this at all.',\n",
       "   \"Because it seemed like 90% of it was about people walking down long dark halls and talking in slightly above whispers. Also there was a lot of overacting.

       "   'SummaryGreat Korean series of space and dystopian science fiction that combines very well its interesting approach to hard science fiction with terror, suspense, horror, action and melodrama, achieving remarkable climates and scenes of great beauty.ReviewIn a dystopian future, the Earth suffers from a severe lack of water, an element that is unevenly rationed according to certain hierarchies. The government forms a team whose mission is to reach a lunar base that had been closed 5 years earlier to search and rescue mysterious samples.The team is made up of professional astronauts, including Captain Han Yun-jae (Gong Yoo, actor from Zombie Station and The Squid Game), a doctor, and Dr. Song, an astrobiologist (Bae Doona, actress from Cloud Atlas and Sense8)Thus begins a story that takes place basically in that present, although with some flash backs referring to some crew members, who in more than one case hide some secrets and motivations.The series combines a very good and interesting hard science fiction with horror, horror, suspense, action and very oriental hints of melodrama. All these components combine very well, enhancing each other, thanks to an intelligent script that knows how to dose the information but always moves the story forward and a direction that puts these ideas and genres into action and creates highly successful climates. On the other hand, the theme of a crew, their secrets and their mistrust is not new, but the script and the staging put it totally at the service of the story and not the other way around.The production display is generous, with many formal finds, great photography, remarkable scenery (the moon base is very accomplished)and a sophisticated soundtrack; The series offers moments of great visual beauty and always sports the characteristic elegance of Korean fiction.As for the performances, an \"oriental\" style coexists at times \"abrupt\" with intense moments, of enormous introspection and sobriety, a record in which a concentrated Bae Doona stands out, for whom the journey of her Dr. Song means much more than a scientific mission.',\n",

       "   \"I liked the actors (from Sense 8 and Train from Busan), but they appear to be miscast in this movie. So many of the characters are so over-the-top; the non-stop talker, the sex-hog, the super dramatic, the one that fears everything, the non-emotional captain, which would not be wrong, but here each character is played to the extreme. Plus, for people who are apparently top of their fields in science, makes very basic mistakes that a fifth-grader would know better. For example, let's touch unknown item without protective clothing, lets breathe air where we see dead bodies with unknown deaths, let get into a life-support suit without checking to see how much oxygen if left or lets walk down dark corridors away from everyone else AFTER there has been deaths and unknown entity lurking (this happens often).As mentioned in other comments, this would have been a tighter, more enjoyable 4-hr miniseries and not this drawn-out plot-device driven mess.\",\n",

Acting also solid (except for Chairperson) and no comic relief at all, fittingly. The intent of RX corporation is too simple but I guess that adds a another complication.Part of the ending where one doesn't need a space suit glaringly doesn't make sense. Microgenomics what have you but that's a pretty quick genetic mutation in 4 years or so. And wasn't too clear why the lead solider need to do the sacrifice move. Slow pacing can turn some audience off and the classical music theme ....well barely worked for me.\",\n",
       "   'Prior to this short 8 part, South Korean, TV series was a short film called, \"The Sea of Tranquility (2014)\" (which I am going to check out as soon as I am done here). The Silent Sea is based on the Sea of Tranquility as is revealed in the season 1 part 4 episode, \\'The Truth Comes Out\\'. Dr. Song\\'s older sister, Song Wonkyung, refers to \"Mare Tranquillitatis\" as the \"Silent Sea.\" Mare Tranquillitatis is a Latin phrase that translates (\"Mare\" meaning Sea) to English as the \"Sea of Tranquility\".There have been a couple of things over the years that had H2O as the basis for the story being laid out but, I can\\'t ever remember having seen a TV series where the star of it was \"WATER (H2O)\". It also has the usual backgrounds - which are the basics of all media output - such as corporate corruption/greed, secret scumbags with their own agenda\\'s going on, intertwining flashbacks, plenty of dramatic moments and total tension throughout its 8 episode run. Oh yes! There is also a twist at the end, that you won\\'t see coming...at all!I don\\'t know why so many reviewers have lambasted this highly entertaining series; using the feeble old saying that its too similar to many things that have been done before. There is hardly anything made in this day and age that is (or can claim to be) totally original...is there? The end result for any film or TV show is to make sure you have a good script, piece together a perfectly matched ensemble cast and make certain that the director can bring out the drama, tension, fear, joy etc, etc! You would never watch anything if you continuously whined on about it not being original!From late 2021 to this year, 2022, we have been gifted some truly incredible television shows - and not one of them American - coming out of South Korea.

Where is the resistance in a vacuum?And taking off their helmets in a facility where they know there could be undetectable bio-hazards, where the staff previously died of unknown causes and before they have checked the air for hazards.

So many things did not make sense which ruined the immersive effect. It is annoying when people make stupid decisions simply because the writers cannot think of another reason to get the characters in a hot spot. But when they use \"smart\" characters (scientists) to make stupid decisions it is even worse.Oh look, everyone died inside this sealed building so let\\'s take off our environmental gear before we figure out why. Faking gravity on a stationary platform is lame also but I suppose there could be some scientific explanation other than the standard rotational gravity.Then they added some \"supernatural\" aspects with the dead sister supposedly being able to contact the other sister and give her information she had no way of knowing unless talking to her dead sister. Then there is the doctor who is frightened of dead bodies. Do they not work on dead bodies when training? If anyone should be at ease around dead bodies it would be the doctor but she is in the top of freaked out.The astro-biologist is the most annoying character. No team leader would have put up with her disobeying orders so many times. Especially when she left another team member alone and they were killed.The visuals and special effects were good but the script was lacking. They should have read through it to see if it makes sense. There was also a lot of things not explained. I suppose they can address them in the next series but it\\'s usually better to answer all of the questions in the same series and use the last episode to create new ones to be answered in the next season. That way if it does get cancelled at least you have most of the questions answered.Overall, it is worth the watch but do not expect it to be up there with Squid Game. I have watched a few movies/tv shows from South Korea that seem to be cashing in on Squid Game but none of them so far reach the greatness of Squid Game. I think it was the script more than anything else that made Squid Game great. It wasn\\'t a highly CGI show, and you had the dubbing or reading the translation for most so it wasn\\'t the acting. Perhaps, Silent Sea isn\\'t as good because none of their characters were ones on the pretty scale. They all looked like the regular Joe off the street.Anyway, you won\\'t be upset if you give it a shot. It is not a 1-2 nor is it a 9-10. People who give shows like this those ratings are doing it to fudge the ratings. There are far better and far worse shows out there. This is a middling show. Not great but not horrible either. I hope that SoKo stops trying to ride Squid Game coattails and puts some more effort into their shows before they are forgotten as a flash in the pan.',\n",

They might not goo too intense, if you expect that - no. Neither go slow, I think this is the best way the events are happening and you can enjoy some very nice scenery in 16:9 which is always to note. And I think all of that greatly represents how hostile the Moon is for us.Acting and music good enough, not spectacular, not an impressive ending, but still it is a nice show just because of its dose of weirdness, I'd say, which seems to disappoint some viewers.

Some suspension of disbelief is a must in places and the last episode falls into some rather tired cliches that I thought had been well avoided up to that point but as a slice of science fiction TV this was entertaining.The earlier episodes as the crew explore the station were very well shot and there was an excellent tension that reminded me of Alien and the video game Dead Space. The ultimate reveal that Luna can walk and breathe on the Moon with no suit wasn't really set up so didn't quite carry the weight I think it was intended to have and the sudden reappearance of the captain outside destroyed the already paper-thin layer of credulity the show was resting on. Personally I would have liked the show to continue the darker tone of earlier episodes but I can also see they wanted a more uplifting ending.At the end of the day though, this is science fiction entertainment, and the fact this series kept me well engaged for over 7 episodes is worth applauding.\",\n",

Flimsy mission premise and prep, some stiff acting and dialogue, round out a bland start.A lot of tropes are there--dystopian future desert Earth (presumably global warming), water rationing, (but technologically advanced and resources enough to have built a massive lunar station, Earth to lunar space shuttles and launch systems, competitive/adversarial government and corporations; some similarities with Aliens, abandoned station, military/para-military/civilian mission team. And of course, some manufactured crisis as a plot device to kick things off.BUT--if you get past the first two episodes, your suspension of disbelief kicks in, and the real story unfolds. Some good ideas get under way, and good actors in the cast start to shine. This is not a deep, ground-breaking sci-fi, but they do manage to start tying together elements into an engaging, if somewhat of a short, predictable thriller.Could they make a Season 2?

       "   \"I was wondering for a few episodes, why is this adventure, sci-fi, drama shot like a horror show? Turns out, it's because for the most part it is one, and to my surprise these horror elements are good. The series doesn't try to scare you, it tries to convey to you the fear the characters feel and it does so rather effectively. While there is barely any gore, characters are constantly under a lot of pressure, and suffer horrifying and painful deaths.Unfortunately it has pacing issues. I found it to be overly long, not much was happening between episodes 3 and 5. The show would have been much better was it 6 episodes long, or if they had used that extra time to flesh out the characters. Some of them are very superficially written, I could barely tell them apart. It was the last 3 episodes that won me over and the reason I would recommend the Silent Sea. The show really picks up.I have a couple more complaints, but I also liked many of the shots, the atmosphere, the lightning and sound, and also most of the acting. Doona Bae is good as always, Gong Yoo whom I've only seen in Goblin and Train to Busan also delivered a good performance, tbh all but one did a pretty good job.Overall it is a character driven sci-fi drama with a lot of horror elements, which has an okayish start, a rather boring middle section and a strong ending. First Korean sci-fi I've seen, give it a try.\",\n",

I really do hope this wins at least some reward, because a lot of hard work went into this.As a viewer; Pay attention to details, there is a lot of foreshadowing and smart little things included that will make sense later on. But you need to be alert. This is not a show you should watch on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn. This requires a little bit more brain-activity than that.However, I\\'m a little bit disappointed. There is some stuff that is left unresolved, and there is a lot of \"suspend your disbelief\" going on here. You can\\'t take this show to seriously, but at the same time you have to talk it seriously enough.The show demands a lot of the viewer, and I have to think that is a failing of the script.I also think 8 episodes are either too much or not enough. They either needed another 4 episode to really get into the nitty gritty details, OR, they need to cut this down to a movie. The 8 episode format works for netflix, because in a sense, you are probably going to binge this and watch it as a long movie. But there are some fat they could have cut out, if that is the case.I would say this is leaps and bounds above the average sci-fi TV-show, but it\\'s still just a sci-fi TV-show.

Seriously though, it's alright but it really is just a straight rip off of aliens, sent to a station by some shady people who don't tell them the full story, discover the horrifying truth, yadda yadda. Production values are pretty good, just a shame the story is so generic.\",\n",
       "   \"Production is top-notch on this one. Some good actors too.The concept is very promising: a Korean governmental lunar permanent research facility found something very important, potentially profitable but hard to manage and very lethal.Things go awry and they bury everything for 5 years. Then a salvage crew is put together to retrieve samples of that something.There are corporate spies infiltrated in the crew (very profitable, remember?) and some people in the crew have deep personal reasons to have joined.Enter Netflix's monkeys with typewriters.The Earth has, for some unexplained reason, LOST ALMOST ALL WATER. There are no more rivers, lakes and OCEANS.Notwithstanding that, people keep on living, with governments supplying water rations. No wars, no riots. Just a merry cattle-like populace.Seriously, the major writer selection criteria at Netflix must be the candidates' IQ. The lower, the better.....So, the salvage crew goes up in a fancy shuttle. Which, naturally, metts with a critical failure that forces the team to separate from the side rockets before a stable moon orbit can be reached.Then the shuttle's own rockets won't start (Korean space engineers must love this show...). Luckily, the trusters do, just so that they can level the shuttle for a crash landing.Where do they end up?At a huge crater rim, half in, half out the border.Netflix should be ashamed.....Well, they have to get out of the shuttle. Some are hanging on seatbelts to avoid falling to the tip of the shuttle (now severely tilted towards the fall).The captain tries to lift a woman hanging. He has to truly exert himself.Moon's gravity is about 16% of the Earth's. In other words, the woman would be weighing some 15 kg.Hardly something that would need a boy to exert himself, let alone an astronaut.Then they get out, just in time for the shuttle to fall. And gravity now seems ok....they walk in little jumpy steps.The station is some 8 km away. On Earth, an average adult covers 6 km/h on foot. Given the gravity on the Moon, this should be at least doubled, so it would take them some 40 min - but it takes a couple of hours, during which they allow a seriously injured man to walk, instead of simply carrying the guy (low gravity.....).Naturally, the air in their cannisters ends just as they get to the station. Very innovative take, Netflix!The stations is a huge place. A lot larger than they knew.They get in, turn on the power.....AND ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY!!!!It's mind-boggling!They have developed artificial gravity for a ground station (so, no rotating rings to use centripetal force as gravity), but they still use combustible fuels on the rockets.....Ah, well.....ok, they have artificial gravity.Let's not be picky and enjoy the show. After all, what other horrid new blunder can the monkeys write in the story?Wait for it.....They find the substance they went looking for. It interacts with living tissue PRODUCING HUGE AMOUNTS OF WATER inside affected individuals without reducing their original mass and quickly killing them, leaving drowning signs on the body. Water from thin air, then....\\nOh...dead bodies are unnafeccted by it.Astounding......The same substance, applied to plants, promote their accelerated growth instead of killing them.Makes absolute sense....Well, among the hundreds dead in the station (no, it wasn't evacuated....) they find an improbable survivor (FIVE YEARS alone in the station....) in the person of a girl of about 12 years of age.She doesn't seem to be negatively affected by the substance, has hugely increased speed and strength (not to mention claw-like nails) and is hellbent in preventing the crew from retrieving any samples.By the way: there's no food left in the station. The girl must have lived on happy memories....or on the strangely non decayed bodies of the original station crew....Seriously.....how do they come up with this level of crap????The girl turns out to be the 79th in an unknown number of clones. All preceding clones died as the substance turned them into water fountains.Things evolve, spies are eliminated, crew members get killed, thousands of tons of water get released in the station, some of it gets out and instantly freezes (at least they didn't make the water flow outside....).The station's structure is severely compromised and the team must get out.Now we are down to 2 women medical doctors, the cloned girl and the captain. The girl has been lovingly tamed and poses no threat.The man must die, so the women don't need to share the glory. As he was a nice guy throughout the series, he gets an honourable death, staving off death for the women and girl for a while.But there are uncountable liters of water spurting non-stop from somewhere.This water wants out - and no puny bulkhead will stop it!So, it comes to pass that the water breaks through the last bulkhead just as the women and girl are getting their feet on lunar sands....and throws them far before freezing.The pressure was enough to blow the bulkhead away, but not enough to crush the captain (paper bulkheads, no doubt....). He is mortally wounded, but alive outside the station.As his suit fails, we see the girl approaching him. She is NO LONGER in her suit. She's exposed to the Moon's surface temperature, but she doesn't freeze at all! Even her eyes work normally!Really, they should have made her pick everybody up and fly back to Earth. At least we could have ended it laughing.\",\n",

Most of the time they're based on earthly rules such as our real world physics. That means that if someone performs magic we're wowed by it, someone loses a lot of blood, we worry for them etc. The silent sea throws all that out, instead giving you a set of physics that are completely inconsistent.For example: in the first episode a spaceship vents it's air after the windows crack when a heavy object hits it. Not only is the glass super fragile (for a god damn spaceship) but the air that escapes and vents out in to space for so long that the shuttle would have to be the size of a large roofed stadium to contain so much air. Maybe that sounds like a minor complaint...but you're faced with these issues every 5 seconds. The Shuttle RCS thrusters are referred to as engines. Conversations that peoppe have are beyond bizzare, with low ranking military having the weirdest conversations with their superiors.

For example, the moonbase set is ridiculously oversized and very impressive, equal to anything you'd see in Hollywood perhaps short only of a Christopher Nolan movie. But the scenes at the Korean space agency on Earth are all filmed in small drab offices and random spaces that scream low budget rather than mission control. It's like they spent all their money on one huge set and had to back fill the other locations with whatever they could scrounge up.It can be hard to get a read on the acting when watching subtitles but overall, we are given no reason to care about the characters fates and it appears the actors didn't care much either. Gong Yoo is so amazing in Train to Busan that I had to check IMDB to see this was actually the same actor, because he makes no real impression here.It's really disappointing, because with better writing this show clearly had the people and budget to make an impact.

And didn't it occur to anyone involved with this production that moon gravity is about 1/6 earth gravity? Perhaps if the story was compelling I might be distracted from the series' glaring science holes. (I also couldn't care less whether the characters live or die, so that's a major problem with the story telling.)\\nI'm going to give it another episode or two, but I may not even finish the first season of this series.It sure is beautiful though. Top-notch visuals.I'm on episode 4 and they still haven't figured out how gravity works on the moon or the science behind plant growth. And I still don't care who lives or dies - although I was happy that the most obnoxious character died in the first episode. I didn't know how much of him I was going to be able to tolerate.I'm watching the last episode. Not sure why I wasted my time with this series. And they found more science to ignore. The same side of the moon always faces the earth. All their science blunders are grade school science! I just saw the finale and it stunk as bad as the rest of the series.

The devastation mankind is facing is water depletion. Rationing of water based on some kind of class rank system, which also includes \"no pets\" policy. Due to this basic premise, you are going to have few climate change deniers and animal lovers bombing the reviews with low scores.Scores of 9 or higher: With so many plot holes, these high scores represent nothing more than show of fandom.The show has a somewhat interesting premise, but it truly fails to live up to its potential. Some of the military crew members act emotionlessly on purpose, and as a result, some scenes are simply monotonous. There are too many plot holes and implausibility that cannot be accepted even for a sci-fi show like this. I can go on and on, but the conclusion is that the show is very average at best.

They are to retrieve some delicate substance in a small container but the space agency does not give them even the basic info so they do not know the core of their mission.But why do we have this stupidity? The answer is business, the producers target and aim to capture a low-culture audience (aka masses) who lack a refined mind. They need actors who would do stupid things on screen but with a character show so audiences associate themselves with these characters or behaviors and not with the science.My low-culture comment is not an insult but only the identification of a social glass ceiling. Low culture is not about freedom or the empowerment of working class or even equality of opportunity but the opposite because it leads to human husbandry.Low culture is often immediate and visceral so there is a limited value to it and it certainly colors the world when high culture can be sterile however when it comes in the form of a production that claims to be science fiction when it is not, this is an insult to Aldous Huxley, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov and others.',\n",

There are also other moments where the science just goes out of the window also. I guess I was more forgiving as Ridley Scott had directed more than a few Sci-Fi/Adventures and should have known better and Prometheus was just the 1st of many for him.The show is set in the future when due to environmental damage by humans, water has become scarcity and now a valuable resource. A team of astronauts is despatched to an abandoned space station to retrieve some highly classified mysterious samples. The mission is steeped in secrecy from the onset, this is slowly peeled away throughout the show's episodes, as terrible choices and actions are made to serve the better good, or worse for the outcome of it. There are some recognisable faces here, Bae Doona from the hugely underrated Sense8, and Gong Yoo from the superb Train to Busan.The Silent Sea impressed me with it's set design, FX and atmospheric cinematography which was way above what a TV show should have. It wasn't all about the eye candy though, the acting was uniformly great, and the story kept me interested. Compared to other vile and horrid Sci-Fi we have been subjected to recently, Picard, Star Trek Discovery & Dr Who, this is Oscar winning stuff compared to them.

The Silent Sea seems to have all the worst parts of other space-centered movies I personally can't stand, like Prometheus or The Cloverfield Paradox. It's all there, perfectly recreated - the wonky space physics, the roster of characters who consistently behave in irrational manners, fail at the most basic steps of communication or just stand there, staring into the distance, while their oxygen runs low or the monster catches up to them. There is a staggering lack of competence amidst the crew, despite their supposedly crucial mission to save humanity.Don't even get me started on the profoundly stale trope of greedy corporations manipulating researchers and soldiers to go on a mission they don't understand to get something dangerous, withholding crucial information that actively jeopardizes their chances of success.At the end of the day this was supposed to be a very simple story - just a bunch of astronauts visiting a space station to retrieve samples. Except from the very beginning the show just insists on twisting and contorting itself to create artificial, unconvincing drama. It might have been innovative... back in the 90s.

Other than that there were no other faults that I could pick up, had the show dealt with the issues mentioned above I would've given this show a 10/10.

Too many scenes were just filler parts. I have no idea in what universe people compare this to Squid Game or other recent South Korean shows. There is nothing at all in common except a couple of actors. Bae Doona is in the excellent South Korean show Kingdom but no one compares it to that. She was also in Sense8 but this show is nothing like that either. This show was obviously written for there to be a second season to answer all those unanswered questions. The writers need to do a better job of making the events more plausible. A guy, who none of the crew has worked with or knows, isn't just going to be allowed to join a top secret mission the day of the launch just because.

I can't point all of them, but I just hate the way it unfolds the Luna water story, and don't get me started on the weird and abrupt ending it has. Some scenes are unnecessary to put it into the big picture considering not even we got the closure of the woman main character's sister that her whereabouts still remains a mystery. Not to forget about the unnecessary drama of deaths that eventually makes me bored because it could've done otherwise. The ending is obviously the most hilarious part in which the main problem of rescuing Sample became a meh situation because they don't give us any closure on how they will act forth after that. They don't even unravel the behind of the survival of one, its survivor as if they don't know how to elaborate more into that matter when it's actually the main topic of this whole journey to the moon. And instead, they gave us a way too open ending that ends abruptly while they had given 8 episodes to explain. The cinematography was quite enjoyable after the first episode and the suspense was also nice and not too long that could make it too boring for me. The acting was excellent considering the cast are all top actors, and I've seen them a lot in a better story. But that's it I guess. I need Korean dramas from Netflix original doesn't always need to have an open ending to hint us for another season, sometimes some stories can only be resolved within a season, and you can make up another issue after that for the next season if only making another season is plausible.\",\n",
       "   \"Since squid game ended i haven't really found any good kdrama to watch. Hellbound was sadly disappointing. So my hopes for Silent Sea was high not just because of Gong Yoo but the trailer seemed well made and intriguing. Also Bae Donna so I was hyped.I literally binged the show in a day and I have to say that I actually really liked it. I was sort of expecting the usual kdrama tropes abt relationship drama/forced comedy or just melodrama in general but this show had none of those. They jumped on the plot on the 1st episode and since then the events keep happening one after the other.Pros : Coming to the plot of the show its nothing unique about going to space to\\ncollect some mysterious specimen with no proper explanation to the crew and obviously a new member with mysterious past is added. I am sure these sort of stories are done many times but what I found interesting was the the social commentary on the earth which was facing drought causing extreme class division. Also how water is something one can't live without but when they find that even a drop of lunar water turns out be to humans biggest enemy bcz it kills the host.I am glad the science talks were sort of dumbed down and explained for ppl to understand, and it wasnt some super complicated mumbo jumbo.The twists and turns were sort of unpredictable i didn't see some of them coming so that was fun.Coming to the characters, I know it's a 8 part series but I wd have liked some back stories for the supporting cast to be able to connect with them as a viewer. Even for Gong Yoo he seemed to have been given a very one toned character. He is a great actor they could have done more with his role by giving him some depth. Bae Dona was the most fleshed out character and she did well !Now the pace of the show at times was very sluggish they cud have easily edited out scenes of them just walking or standing and breathing. I understand that at times it necessary to create the claustrophobic space atmosphere but there were too many scenes like this.The CGI was at times looking funny but I dont expect it to be Hollywood movie like so I can ignore that.All in all I would definitely suggest this show as a sci fi fan i thoroughly enjoyed it even with some faults.

Overall, it\\'s slow-burning with a somber mood, different from other sci-fis of this kind giving out a realistic feel of their challenges, no aliens or creatures about but something more mysterious and deadly, with intriguing twist and turns and you have to watch all the episodes patiently to really experience the show. There is also a very important message - climate change and the effects on future generations like water shortages which can easily happen if not already. Some of the acting surprisingly was not up to par for me but maybe because this whole project was a complete new experience for all involved. I think, the show would have been better with fewer episodes but for a new director and first attempts at this kind of genre, I was really impressed and enjoyed the show.However, I like to point out somethings based on the comments/reviews I have seen a lot lately (Squid Game, Hellbound, My Name, etc.):1) There is so much comparing every recent S. Korean show that comes out to Squid Game. Even the reputable sites that review films/TV shows are doing it. It\\'s ludicrous and at this point aggravating as if all recent S. Korean shows must somehow be like Squid Game to be worthy or that\\'s all they have to offer!2) I have seen some reviews that seem suspicious and generic whether rated high or low. Sadly, I have even seen few racist ones!! Not sure even any of these ratings were based on actually watching the shows??3) There is always some comparing the shows from other countries to Hollywood ones as if that is the \"ultimate standard\". International shows have become very popular in recent years so they must be doing something right. Viewers these days, at least some, are looking for something really original, unpredictable and emotionally engaging and with natural acting and great character build up/storytelling (fast or slow-burning) which is offered more in international films and TV series than the Hollywood productions. You can find reviews/comments to that effect as well.Anyways, I definitely recommend watching this show because it has a new approach to this type of genre.

However, when the water they created touched any normal human, it would drown them internally.Fast forward, the girl bit one of the astronauts hands who came back to retrieve the water, and through this, it showed humans that her DNA was the saviour to their failure (of the intake of the created water drowning the humans).Hope you're with me. So literally if you get some of the fish gill looking girls' DNA, you can then consume the man made created water, and will not drown internally and die from it. Inevitably, saving the earth from mankind dying of not having water. :DWell, that's how I perceived it!I found the music to be very good! Calming and serene.

That being said, it's worth sticking with it, as it gets into its stride from episode 3 onwards.One final comment I'd make is that, as is usually the case, it's far a better experience to watch in the original Korean with English subtitling. The American accents in any dubbed production are incredibly jarring, and for me, they wrench me out of the action. It's much more enjoyable to hear the actual voices of the actors delivering their lines than the dubbed voices of their English speaking counterparts.

It wasn't paced like a shocking thriller in the way many of our mystery shows and movies are now (at least in the west). Instead it was paced in a way that allowed a more natural discovery of information. The audience was there with the crew the whole time and perhaps the suspense came more from always expecting something bigger than what we got.Though the relief of smaller surprises and the satisfaction of being just a step ahead is short-lived.It's undercut at every turn but shocking deaths and the aforementioned betrayals. Leading the audience to a finale where anything can happen and the stakes are astronomically high.The ambiguity of the ending is risky when a lot of viewers will want a satisfying end or a promise for more but the ambiguity is in keeping with the overall tone and really fits the series.It may not be the next best show on Netflix but it certainly is worth a watch.\",\n",

Had I discovered a body in the fridge and the samples missing, I\\'d be screaming down the mic within seconds.Then we have a seasoned doctor who (like most doctors) is quite at ease performing autopsies and cutting bodies open, and in the next scene suffering a total break down when they discover a body!On the moon\\'s surface, team precariously low on oxygen, running to make it to the station in time, yet the 5ft doctor has to help carry the injured team member? And afterwards the whole team sitting around while he is eventually dying on a rock, with no knowledge whether they can even make it to the station? Without sending some of the men at least forward to prepare and unlock the doors?And again, the whole team are running to escape from the deluge, and the commando at the rear letting a 5ft female doctor hop along carrying a very large samples case, instead of taking it himself! On one hand running to escape danger, but obviously not in a hurry?!In many cases the team\\'s actions so slow, so hesitant, with no sense of urgency, even when they are running away from danger. They stop to talk, to look at each other meaningfully, spending ages on inaction...In the end scenes, a seasoned commando, faced with a crazy sociopath/murderer/traitor, and with a tidal wave right on them, takes his sweet time and small talk before finally deciding to shoot him, and when he eventually does, in such a clumsy manner, that ends up getting shot himself!Communications down and the whole team cannot reach earth base using the station\\'s ultra powerful transmitters, yet the traitors in the team carry pocket radios which do the job just fine?! Why can\\'t the captain also carry one of those little pocket radios then?How could this mission ever leave earth with no clear instructions, and having to depend solely on random chance to discover a hidden and undocumented 50% of the lunar station. They do not know what they are looking for and what they are meant to retrieve. It is utterly illogical. No, it is trash.How can green plants grow in complete darkness?The lunar water carries a novel virus which is undetectable and allows the water to replicate when in close proximity to \"living cells\". Define \"living cells\"? And where does the extra matter come from? Why did the substation fill up with water, what \"living organism\" triggered it? And again where did the extra matter come from to fill up the whole lunar station?',\n",

This is a solid 7.5 - 8.0 netflix series (I'm giving it a 10 to balance out these 1/10 ratings from haters). I think the director did a great job in building character of the protagonists. One thing that could be improved was to build background story of the antagonists like the two mercenaries and how they came to deal with an evil organization. The setting was amazingly done to showcase the consequences of water scarcity. Room for improvement would have been to portray the dying lifeforms of earth and go into more depth into how vulnerable human beings would behave when pushed to their limits. The plot was smooth, but I felt that the movie could have utilised the background actors a little more. For example, going on a rampage before they liquefy. Gong-yoo and the protagonists showed amazing acting skills and their emotions really showed.

Why would a scientist (Bae Doona) immediately remove her helmet after being told there\\'s no radiation, and THEN turn on the station air purifier?(3) It\\'s the time of the COVID pandemic.

Ok.(4) It\\'s been FIVE YEARS since the station was abandoned! Why are bodies not rotten, dessicated, etc???!!

Unfortunately, my faint hope that the show would improve was quickly snuffed out, as characters make comically bad decisions, the tension built feels hollow, and the resolution is wholly unsatisfying.Certain members of this hand-picked team of seasoned professionals, which could very well be mistaken for a bunch of inapt amateurs, perish like flies, while others are protected by plot armour so massive that it has its own gravitational pull.The talented cast is utterly wasted on underdeveloped characters who often appear incapable of logical thinking and engage in pointless bickering which prolongs the audience's suffering. The fact that the second traitor in the team, who acts as the primary villain for the second half of the show, never reveals his motivations, briefly shows signs of regret, only to double down and do everything in his power to hinder the heroes' mission even through his final emotional breakdown, only serves to reveal the true villains of the series - the writers.\",\n",

       "   'The Silent Sea is a sci-fi mystery drama that takes place in a near apocalyptic Earth where water is becoming a rare commodity. An abandoned moon station may have the answer that can save humanity\\'s plight. So how was it?Meh. Lets take a quick dive.Plot/premise - Original idea with boring execution. The first 1-3 episodes are interesting, however it becomes very slow afterwards with a rushed ending that does not conclude a lot of the existing plot. When the mystery is revealed, it still goes on. However, major plot holes will be noticed if you pay attention - particularly with the questionable actions of characters. Also, this plot did not have to take place on the moon. It really doesn\\'t. Nothing about the plot uses elements of space or the moon - rendering the setting just window dressing. They do not explore the moon or its crevasses. They are outside the station 1-3 times (minus the start and end). \\'Lunar Water\\' is a fictional commodity - and thus is not related to the moon in any capacity. The plot could have taken place in Antartica with \"Artic Water\" or an abandon Indian research lab where its gotten too hot and thus the city evacuated. It has no reason to take place on the moon. After realising this, the story is a lot less impressive.Characters - Fun chemistry between a few, but the main protagonist is a bore to follow. Same facial expressions for 7 episodes with constant bickering and complaining. I wish the story followed the captain\\'s story, has his motivations are a lot more fleshed out and reflective of his actions. He has moral decisions to make as the captain - but less so with the current protagonist. She\\'s boring, passive, and I look forward to seeing the other characters. As mentioned previously, the actions of many characters are questionable at best, suspending the immersion.Visuals and setting - Very pretty and realistic. The Moon base had a sense of space and direction, and eventually the viewer will know the ins and outs of it. Sadly, the entire setting is just window dressing. The setting of a dying earth is poorly done. Apart from seeing a small queue of people waiting for water, and a brown earth from space (which may be the only reason this story takes place there), there is ZERO SENSE OF URGENCY. The people on earth look like they are doing just fine, and there is no \\'ticking time bomb\\' of any capacity, given the characters on earth are not suffering, the characters on the moon are vibing and easily communicating with earth.Overall, the tv show has an interesting premise which should have been executed better and with more thought. It was a \\'meh\\' experience, with pretty visuals and some interesting dynamic and original plot. However, when you realise the moon is just window dressing - its all just a disappointing show leaving you wanting more.',\n",

The rocket engines were shown burning but the crew were shown in zero g. Entering the moons orbit again the rocket engines were shown burning, but not to slow down into orbit. It's details like these that ruin a fantasy and prevent suspension of disbelief. It's lazy on the part of the production team to to either not do their homework, or assume the audience won't notice.A couple of other things that stood out are the pilot struggling with his joystick as he tries to land the space shuttle. Struggling against what? There is no atmosphere. There is also the amount of air rushing out of what is a fairly small shuttle...Five stars because I didn't get very far and if you can get past the lack of even fantasy physics there might be a story worth watching here.For context I like Star Wars, but that is set in a fantasy universe but this is not which is why I'd hope for at least a little basic realism.

None of these should have necessarily meant it would be unwatchable or even bad, but in this case it just means that it has no redeeming values at all.I won\\'t rehash the plot, as there\\'s nothing more to it than the description you\\'ve probably already read, with the exception of some presumed twist that I could scarcely have cared less about after 45 mins. You\\'ve seen it all before and probably done much better. Despite this, what actually let it down was the script, which is basically your standard Korean fantasy about a group of schoolkids suddenly finding out they have special gifts and have to save the world. Except the actual characters are none of those things - they are supposed to be trained, disciplined, capable adults - scientists, doctors, spacecraft pilots - yet they never act that way. Their dialogue is juvenile babble of the sort teenagers think professional adults speak like. Individuals who are supposed to be skilled and proficient at complicated tasks act like dithering idiots and make the most ridiculous decisions. That a 7km hike across the flat surface of the moon, which has 1/3 the gravity, is portrayed as such an arduous, grueling affair suggests that the writers haven\\'t even walked that far on earth before in their lives. And I think that\\'s the essence of this - the people who manufactured this stinking mess clearly had no ideas of their own and were just given a pile of money to make \"something\" because they\\'d made something before that had been marginally successful.

The idea of Lunar Water was fascinating in its possibilities and dangers. There are some parts that are needlessly drawn out and hurt the momentum of the story. Like Taesuk's death - OMFG I swear he's probably still alive up there. The ending, sadly, is where it fails.

The visuals are pretty good - they do look a little cheap in certain scenes, but it didn't really bother me. What really stands out is the cinematography. It really aides the storytelling. The soundtrack was quite good, as well.The only real drawbacks are the pacing and the worldbuilding. At times, scenes crawl to a halt as the characters are seemingly stuck staring at one another for no apparent reason. It became quite frustrating at times. And while I'm no scientist, there were some pretty immersion-breaking inaccuracies. There were also a few pointless plot threads that weren't enough to be red herrings, and instead ended up just seeming like wastes of screen time.Overall, though, this is a cold, dystopian sci fi that turns into a grounded, emotional tale of magical realism.

(BTW the English voice overs where way better than Squid Games)Unfortunately the last two episodes ruin this whole series.Spoilers....Yeah you can't walk around the moon without a space suit. You still need air and never mind the decompression from taking the space suit off.Trust me and skip this. It was mostly OK and got pretty good at some points, only to fall apart at the end.\",\n",
       "   \"It's classified as a triller it is it, full of plot holes things that does not make sense even when trying to classify it as sci-fi, good actors but terrible history and it's does not have good visual effects.\",\n",
       "   \"Unfortunately the concern from the trailer came true. Astronauts or scientists don't say like that.Just a simple misfire collaborated by someone who doesn't love the genre, someone who doesn't know how to write a script, and someone who couldn't correct the course and let this brought into the world.Don't give it a try. Worthless.\",\n",
       "   \"As a scifi fan, I have watched so many tv shows and movies that show outrageous stories and stupid probability. However, I think Korean did good job on approaching this type of genre compare to others. It has a story and a message. I know their budget was not much high as others. However, I hope Netflix keep investing money on Korean directors and create various content to entertain us more and more. It was much better than other stupid tv shows and movies that contain 0 story and only showing stupid visuals and effects. I can't wait to see more creative content from Korean.\",\n",
       "   \"The series is bad. I mean really bad.Could have been barely watchable in an 1.5h movie, but in 8 long episodes is too much time wasting.Earth has lost all its water because why not? Shuttle in space loses one bolt out of nothing, then main engine fails to start, just because. Then they crash into the moon, violently shaking all the way like they were going through the atmosphere or some sort. And they crash on the surface almost smoothly, it's not like there were going few km/sec like in real life.The science feels like Armaggedon, it's trully a mess and an insult to every man with a brain. And in contrast with Armaggedon which has bad science, but is enjoyable due to good actors, relatable characters, fast paced action and some dramatism, this series is way too slow, characters are flat and antipathetic, no action or backstory make you care about them if they die or not, the story drags on and on forever without becoming interesting (if that ever happens). Don't waste your time in this Netflix attemp to cash in koreean movies, based on Squid Game success.\",\n",
       "   'If you can get through the dubbed dialogue you will be rewarded. A bit slow sometimes but I thought the concept is true to our current world environmental issues. A smart tension filled movie. Makes one feel like a small piece of a huge universe and thought millions of generations.',\n",
       "   'The first season of 8 episodes is very wonderful and breathtaking, I watched episode after episode, that reminded me of the classic horror movie series Alien.',\n",
       "   'Honestly one of the worst sci-fy series i´ve ever watched i fell sorry for the time i wasted watching it.Everything the Expanse did right, this series did it all wrong, logic holes which are so big, a death-star could fit through it, there we have a shuttle at almost orbital speed crashing in the planet without much damage, plowing through lunar mountains, then gets destroyed from a 30m fall.The whole scrip was just bad, and without any depth. There was not a single decent dialogue in the series.Elements and Atoms appearing out of nowhere,\\nLunar atmosphere? Seriously? What kind of drugs were used writing that script? The Atmosphere on lunar is so thin, it´s whole mass is below 10 metric tons.Plants made no sense.Actors were not really good too, characteres were completly generic\\nIf you cut the series down to 90 minutes, it would probably made a decent B/C movie you could actually enjoy after a lot alcohol after watching other movies like Megashark vs Mechashark etc.Absolute waste of time, only thing thats interessting me is who the hell at netflix wasted money purchasing the rights for that aweful disgrace of a TV series.1/10 Stars, sadly there´s no way to give less, 0,5 would be fair.',\n",
       "   \"Being a sci-fi fan I really wanted this to be good but the characters were kinda boring, it was slow moving and there were too many outlandish things left unexplained. It was visually pretty well done but that's about it.\",\n",
       "   'This low score is for the individuals who disregarded all of science for \"creative purposes\". I understand, it\\'s a show. I\\'m sure the budget was hell (at least I kind of hope it was, that would explain a lot), but this show is really bad. Like Armageddon(1998) bad. Acting was pretty good though.',\n",
       "   \"Very Solid, on an all round basis. Actually quite blown away at how impressive this TV series was. Ticked all the boxes. And as a space enthusiast, I may possess a little bit of bias BUT they were spot on with attention to detail. A strong plot was the most impressive aspect. Offering a nice balance between Sci-Fi, Thriller, Drama and Horror and executed well. This one season was better than the past 2 seasons of The Expanse, I'm sorry to say. Korean productions are on the rise and should be taken very seriously.\",\n",
       "   \"I usually don't write bad reviews but for a Sci-fi fan like me this show felt like a crime. Yes it was that bad.Generic plot, bad dialogues and worst of all extremely stupid characters. You would think they would choose smart people for a space mission like this but somehow these characters are regularly surprised by the most obvious things. They are incapable of putting 2 and 2 together and make the worst decisions. This more than anything makes this show so frustrating to watch.\",\n",
       "   \"Not a fan of this genre but after squid game i'm trying to watch other korean works on netflix and give it a try w/o much expectation.Glad i started it cause the plot is very simple but very well done hope for a season 2\\nLoved the main actors.\",\n",
       "   'Very atmospheric, intriguing and thoughtful. Pace is slow and beautiful but there is a lot going on. So much better than your typical Hollywood sci-fi. Moon shots are truly amazing and breathtaking.',\n",
       "   \"This Korean SciFi should have been rejected by the filmakers before wasting so much time. You can sum it up as:\\nFilm sets clobbered up from airplane parts:Endless time consuming and pointless scenes of various people running around dimly lit tunnels with no dramatic effect.Absurd ignoring of technical impossibilities:\\nEx: Space vehicle being driven by manipulation of a control stick as used in airplanes flying in an atmosphere but worthless in space.Water spontaneaously being created from nothing.I can't believe I wasted the time watching the entire season. Please, spare the world from Season two.\"],\n",

       "   'You are in for a treat. The first few episodes of most Kdramas are better than entire seasons of western shows! Around the halfway mark in the episode roster the writers usually throw in a lot of brand new plot arcs and twists. Kdramas initially specialized in romcoms, but now they lead in all genres. This specific series includes a wide range of themes -- horror, high school drama, politics, fighting -- you seldom see mixed together. Great TV.',\n",
       "   'Korean Drama \" Uncanny Counter \" is a wonderful blend of action, comedy and family dynamics.The drama has a perfect atmosphere, almost like a webtoon, with perfect action scenes and a beautiful world built. The drama introduces the universe of the counters slowly and the viewer gets to know it at the same time as the main character. The family dynamics of the small group of the counters were perfect, emotional at times, funny at others. The story is also full of small cases that the counters had to solve, which were interesting and entertaining, while it follows the main \\'big\\' mystery of the case that eventually involves everyone.The performances were great as well, and everyone had the perfect chemistry with each other. However, the main lead got annoying and tiring to watch when he was struggling to maintain the barrier thing, as it looked a bit fake and overacted. But the rest of his acting was really good. Also, the guys of the \\'other side\\' were overbearing at times.So, overall, 8.5 out of 10 for this pretty entertaining drama.',\n",
       "   'I eventually found the battles too long and redundant, and some of the evil stuff and bullying repetitive and over the top. But I enjoyed the cast very much. The leads had great chemistry and were endearing. Would definitely watch Season 2 because I like them so much.',\n",
       "   'In an imaginary Korean city murderers are taken over by evil spirits that then feed on the souls of those they murder. Luckily for the world there are a special group of people called counters who with their fighting abilities defeat the spirits releasing the trapped souls and bringing the human to justice. The counters in this city are an eclectic mix all with different special abilities to try to defeat the spirits. When web toons are brought to the screen I believe the stories are often less fluid but this flows really well and is very entertaining with good performances from the entire cast.',\n",
       "   'Think its safe to say this is a good series and should be good til the end, acting and story are above average',\n",
       "   'Either I have been extremely fortunate, or there is simply a treasure trove of K-dramas that I have had the pleasure of watching that have simply been superb! Series from \"Mr. Sunshine,\" to \"Descendants of the Sun\" to \"It\\'s Okay to Not Be Okay,\" to \"Crash Landing on You,\" to \"Stranger\" and on and on. I have been exposed to the very best that Korean television has had to offer, and I\\'m still leaving out many others.On the surface, a viewer may look at this as a sort of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" type series where three individuals (which becomes four) run a Noodle restaurant, but on the side, they\\'re catching demons, i.e. evil spirits. These people are called \"Counters\" as they are imbued with special, superhuman abilities from their \"sponsors\" or \"counterparts\" in Yung (a sort of staging area before moving on to \"heaven.\"). To look at this series with those eyes is to short-change it dramatically.Like nearly all great K-drama series, this series is driven by great, and even deep characterizations with a rich story that actually has something to say; how to deal with bullies, both within the school system as well as within the corporate world; those who would prey upon the weak and helpless.Someone once said that evil tends to pervade when good people do nothing to stop it. Many consider this to be even worse than becoming \"evil.\"The story centers around Mun, a young high school boy who\\'s suffered untold and unspeakable horrors by losing his parents in an accident and also the physical disabilities that are the result. And yet, he never hesitates to jump in and protect his friends and those who are \"weak.\" Where most people would hesitate or not act at all, he doesn\\'t even think about it. He simply acts. And while he can be impulsive and wears his emotions on his sleeve, he is essentially fearless when it comes to doing the right thing.\"The Uncanny Counter\" is a testament to the ideal belief that even the smallest person can make a difference. Yes, the Counters have special powers, but they are also only four people going up against a system. Much like Superman who always finds himself in over-his-head against Lex Luthor...someone who uses the power of the system against him.One of the things I love about K-dramas, is that they aren\\'t afraid to allow their characters to demonstrate natural emotions. In this way, we are given deluge of deep, realistic, and relatable characters. We are also usually given something to really think about. In this series, we are presented with the idea that a person doesn\\'t need to have special abilities or super powers in order to do the right thing; that, indeed, one person, no matter how small, can make a difference. It also conveys the truth that no one needs to stand alone. Bullies are cowards. All of them. And they are easily dealt with when people rally together to fight them.All of the performances in this series are fantastically done. Characters that will make you laugh, sniffle, and evoke raw emotion. I suppose there is a reason why I\\'m far more into K-dramas right now than American shows, which no longer seem to provide me with stories and characters that speak to me. Instead, we\\'re given a barrage of CGI, wooden characters that have virtually no depth at all.',\n",
       "   '10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020/2021 South Korean fantasy, mystery, thriller series with 16, 70 minute, episodes.Set in the fictional city of Jungin in South Korea, a group of Counters are charged with ridding the world of evil spirits. The evil spirits posses human hosts who have either committed murder or are evil to the extent they would be willing to. Being possessed by the evil spirit compels the human host to kill and \"consume\" the spirit of the victim making the evil spirit grow increasingly strong and more difficult to extricate and send on to the spirit realm. The Yung, God like inhabitants in a realm that exists between Earth and afterlife, team with people who are in the half living state of medical coma and allow them to live if they agree to fight the demons. The Counters are not only restored to health but also are given supernatural powers and superhuman strength. Ga Mo-tak (Yoo Jun-sang) is an older male Counter who is much stronger and more forceful than the other counters. As a former detective he is also able to use his investigative skills to hunt down the murdering spirits. Do Ha-na (Kim Se-jeong) has the ability to sense when a human hosting an evil spirit enters the Counter\\'s territory. Choo Mae-ok (Yeom Hye-ran) is able to heal others and as an older woman is motherly and nurturing. To cover their real purpose, the counters run a noodle shop around their busy demon hunting schedule.\\nIn the beginning of the series, there was a fourth Counter Jang Cheol-joong (Sung Ji-ru) but a super powerful Level 3 (Level one being weakest) evil spirit kills him and consumes his spirit. His Yung companion spirit, Wi-gen (Moon Sook) has to quickly find another partner spirit and winds up drawn to and pairing with a young, non comatose, teenager, So Mun (Jo Byung-gyu). This unique pairing leads Wi-gen to believe this young person, who is slightly crippled on one side, has something unique to offer. To convince the young man, the team offers to heal his crippling injury and allow him to talk to his parents who were killed in the car accident that injured him when he was only 11. Soon the team finds that they desperately need the help of this young man who proves to be the most powerful and diverse Counter of them all. As the team fights many battles together, their bound grows into that of a close knit family. They find that tragic events in their past also tie them together and compel them to risk everything to send perhaps one of the most powerful and evil spirits they have ever encountered to the afterlife.Spoilers*. I am a huge fan of supernatural and action dramas. I like strong male and female characters a complex yet easy to follow plot and lots of character development. This series had it all. The main character was such a cute and likable young person it was easy to understand why the group would so quickly and deeply take to him. The action scenes left me wondering if the actors were doing their own stunts because they were amazing and very fluid. There was a little romance sprinkled in although that was in no way a central focus. The central character\\'s growing skill was fun to watch. We were immediately drawn in and hooked to the last scene. It ended well (not sad) and plot points were wrapped up. There will be a second season but do not think that means this one did not wrap up. It stood lone well yet has some elements that would nicely carry to the next season. Highly recommend this series.',\n",
       "   'I truly enjoyed this show so much! I usually like to binge-watch my shows, but this one I watched week to week, and its format really worked and kept me interested and excited for every new episode.The premise is interesting and fun, and the characters are just perfect across the board. So Mun is such a perfect protagonist; he is cute and brave and charming in all the right ways so you continually love and root for him the whole time. His \"found family\" is the best mix of characters; the cold but protective Ha Na, the gruff Mo Tak, and the sweet mom-like Ma-Ok make a wonderful group of very watchable character moments. Also a shout out to the over the top character of Jang Mul, who was a total scene stealer!The soundtrack is fun and upbeat/heroic with some beautiful sad songs thrown in for an even toned mix. The cinematography was well rounded, with some very decent and cool special effects. The bad guys are successfully bad without being too over the top (although the end fight definitely gave me those vibes). There were some cringe moments and a few times where the plot felt a bit redundant, but overall this was an extremely enjoyable watch. I would definitely recommend and even watch again!',\n",

Of course it's all English subtitles for me and some of the unexplained cultural scenes are lost on me, but those are few and far between.

       "   'High schooler, Mun, has a new job at the noodle restaurant. It\\'s not so much about serving noodles as it is training to go out and 86 some evil spirits.This is an excellent, action-packed thriller about \"counters\" who hunt down evil spirits. Mun is chosen to be the replacement for a counter who was killed while in the line of duty. He\\'d been left with a twisted leg from an accident in which his parents died. He is crippled and walks with a brace.When he is brought in to meet the other counters they give him the scoop on what the job entails. I appreciate them establishing some of the ground rules. There\\'s a lot of Dramas that fail to do so, which often creates confusion, or the appearance that they\\'re cheating- coming up with stuff as they go.What is a little confusing here is their strength. For Mrs. Chu: Is she three times as strong as an average man or the average older woman? Also, the way they\\'re able to jump so high seems like more than the average person thrice multiplied. They clearly have different levels of strength to go with their different specialties. The team consists of 4 active fighters and a retired one who handles the funding.The team becomes a family unit. They must work with each other closely in extremely stressful situations. Clear communication and trust are essential to bolster the team\\'s effectiveness.The mother-son relationship that forms between Mrs. Chu and Mun is so sweet. He had lost his parents, and she her son. Therefore, they can help each other.Even though using powers for non-counter situations is prohibited, Mun, whose leg was healed when he became a counter, begins chasing the bullies out of school with his newfound strength and agility. This will get him into trouble eventually.Mun also develops a crush on the pretty, but prickly Ha-na from the first moment she entered his line of sight.Early in the show the team encounters an extraordinarily powerful and rare \"level three\" evil spirit. The more people an evil spirit kills, the more powerful that spirit becomes. Conversely, the more evil the host person was originally, the more compatible the evil spirit will be with the host.After a kill, the evil spirit consumes and traps the victim\\'s soul. Once the counters catch an evil spirit and send him to justice, those souls are released, but if the evil spirit is killed prior to the release, the souls are lost. Their strategy, therefore, is to always catch alive and release the souls.Mun learns the accident that killed his parents was no accident: It was murder. The perpetrator was none other than the 3rd-level evil spirit, whose host was a hitman.Hitman don\\'t act on their own. The backdrop is a corrupt political system from the police to the mayor and beyond. The mayor had ordered the hit on Mun\\'s police detective parents, and also on fellow Counter, and former police detective, Mo-Tak. The attempt on Mo-Tak\\'s life left him in a coma, which is when he was recruited as a Counter. Most of the Counters had been coma patients: They are more willing to accept risks to get back into life, which makes for easier recruiting.Mun and the team start a race to save Mun\\'s parents\\' souls before it\\'s too late. Meanwhile, the powerful evil spirit starts recruiting his own evil team, making the Counters\\' jobs all the more challenging. Mun starts showing that his skills as a Counter are far from ordinary......This is yet another K-drama in which every element is excellent: The acting, directing, and writing all work well to advance the story. Special effects are good and support the plot instead of taking over as a centerpiece. The villain is really creepy, and really evil. It\\'s altogether worthy of respect.The writer worked in a few nice set up lines. For instance, when Mrs. Chu announces: \"We won\\'t lose anyone in this photo.\" Soon after that..... Well, watch and see. Also, 7 yrs back, Mo-Tak tells Ofr. Jeong, when he insists on going to a dangerous mtg: \"Take your umbrella. I think rain is coming.\"In EP 7 there\\'s a crazy fight scene with an original concept. Ha-na has entered Mun\\'s memory of the accident to help him remember more. The evil spirit actually materializes into Mun\\'s memory of him.....and then they fight.......and then they fight while slipping in and out of other places, such as the evil spirit\\'s home, and then back inside the memory......\\nO. H. M. Y. They should have built on that in one more scene. The concept was too awesome to be left hanging out there as a one-off.It\\'s common for sci-fi fantasy entertainment to run into logical gaps. This shows has some. One of the biggies is: Why don\\'t the evil spirits just bring a gun to the fistfight and drop the counters like wet noodles?? I don\\'t recall them addressing this. Maybe they did. I didn\\'t observe any flaws that were serious enough to affect viewing pleasure.And what a pleasure this shows is!

Heartwarming characters and lots of a-list cameos round out the main cast, and make for a fresh take on the whole \"teenage superhero\" trope. Even the various baddies are well executed, each having their own unique \"flavor\" which sets them apart.Also, special shout outs to Ahn SukHwan and Ok JaYeon. ASH is frequently cast as a villain/antagonist (which he always plays well), but that only made it extra endearing to see him play a rich, eccentric lovebird/mentor this time around. I was tickled every time he made an appearance! :) And as for OJY, she has insanity down PAT! After seeing her in \"Mine\" on Netflix, I am firmly a fan of her amazing acting chops!

Harry Potter is even name-dropped.It's also overacted and overly sentimental at times. With a bit of slapstick comedy - the tone is all over the place. Cliches are abundant, like Kill Bill music playing in action scenes.

Characters are likable, and their powers are enough to put you at the edge of your seat. Many fighting scenes are just breathtaking, which to me are the highlight of the series. But it's also unavoidable to notice the unnecessarily melodramatic scenes--especially at the last episode, where everything wrapped up and resolved too neatly.

I watch a lot of kdrama and some take a few episodes to get good, some are really promising at first and then just get repetitive, others have a few episodes in the middle that start to drag or there's those that are good all the way up until a disappointing end. This drama doesn't fit into any of those categories because it stays consistently amazing all the way through. The storyline is gripping and develops well as everything begins to tie in together. Acting is on point. There is the perfect combination of humour, action and emotional scenes. The characters compliment each other well and it is great to see their characters develop and relationships with each other build. I love that the ending left it open for a season 2 which I would most definitely watch.\",\n",

This show doesn't take itself too seriously and I LOVE that.\\nIt's funny and emotionally compelling.

I could be nitpicking but these small details are important. It felt like they were extending it or poor execution of a plot twist.\",\n",

       "   'I have rather mixed feelings on the show. Not a bad series to watch if you can focus on the relationship aspect of the drama. The last episode, rather, was a brilliant end to So-mun\\'s struggle with blaming himself for his parents\\' death. I loved the end when it showcased the inner dilemma of the main cast, when he saved his parents and yet it was a struggle to speak out despie him loving and missing his parents after 7 years. The film captured the idea of friendship well and So-mun\\'s upright character in his behaviour in school and even towards his bullies.Like many Korean dramas out there, it is quite a shame that the show allocated a lot of its scenes towards the action (of course, it\\'s an action drama after all). However, the action scenes aren\\'t well filmed, especially when it is coupled with CGI-backed psychokinesis. Many of those are also a repetition of \\'when main cast A is about to die, main cast B jumps in to save him\\' and back-and-forth. One major downside of the show is its predictability, as anyone can probably tell from the start that the main lead will definitely be the one who is going to defeat the main antagonist and save his parents at the end. There are quite a number of flaws regarding how the action scenes are constructed as well - especially in the last episode, two of the main cast were on the verge of being punched to death, and yet could get up rather effortlessly to stop a van driving downhill. In other words, the action scenes, the logic behind how the counters carry out their \"battles\" and the general plot could use some improvements.If you are in it for the action, you would want to consider watching something else. If not, the message of the show and how it showcased the raw emotions of the characters and the relationships built around them are really enjoyable.',\n",

The fighting scenes are long, but well thought out and add to the story. They could've dialed a bit back on the high school bullying part, but after the first couple episodes that issue is done for.All in all a great action packed drama for all the lovers of 'magical powers' and people who are looking for new series to binge-watch.

Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect and it's not the best show ever made. It has it's flaws. Certain things here and there that doesnt make that much sense, and the first episode was in my opinion not that good compared to the rest of the show. It felt off and frankly a little gringe and weird, but the other 15 episodes were fantastic.The action/fight scenes and visual effects are great, but the story and characters are what made the show special to me.

Each of the main characters is clearly fleshed out by the end of the series and that's what makes their successes and development so enjoyable. We aren't just expected to like them because they're conventionally good looking, we are presented with characters who are real. What many Korean dramas do is that they focus solely on young characters, and though our main protagonist is in high school, this does not take away from the complexities and the development that we get to see in the older characters, especially in Ms. Chu (I highlight her particularly because too many films and series will neglect the competent roles of women who aren't in their twenties).With well thought out twists and turns the story unfolds as the team works to catch evil spirits, but also fight against unjust city officials in Jungjin. If you're looking for a show that doesn't shy from the evils of people while also holding up the power of meaningful supportive relationships, this is for you.\",\n",

In this one, the main characters are well enough realized and sympathetic enough to make me care about them; the premise is novel enough that I hung in through the second episode.The show is a far cry in suspense and plot from the police/mystery videos I normally gravitate to (\"Live\", \"Mr. Sunshine\" \"Voice\"), but the likable characters and odd premise (very small group endowed with superpowers improbably arrayed against evil beings of unspecified number, likewise endowed) is interesting enough so far.

This goes deep into the feelings of each and how important they are. In the emotionally charged scenes the acting was so genuine I literally cried. I was caught off guard by this show and I can't say enough how I've enjoyed it. Even when trying to explain some of the dynamics between Mun and say his grandmother for instance, I fell apart due to the fact I had the same experience with my grandmother as she was passing. This looks into relationships of all sorts and the complicated web we weave in trying to be acknowledged, loved, guarded, vulnerable and accepted.

But i think Mun being the maknae and ace at the same time adds such a cute touch (and a huge asset) to the counters as a whole. I felt like the way So Mun made the other counters' life brighter wasn't talked about much. And seeing So Mun grow up to be such a responsible boy made me proud of him.

But do they have to fight WITHOUT any proper weapons beside their fists? And don't get me started on those ridiculous red track suits, what kind of attack can that block?! Being 2 or 3 times stronger than normal human doesn't mean you should run thoughtlessly to danger without anything to fight them and to protect yourself. They are strong, yes, but their enemies are also strong. The whole fight scene is a child's play!! The plot was quite interesting and that was the only reason I put myself through the 1st episode.
